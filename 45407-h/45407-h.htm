<p>It consists of a Work Holder,
Thread Cutter,
Needle Cushion
and Spool
Stand, all combined
in one
article; made of Plated
Metal; simple and durable.
It can be quickly
attached to any work table
or top of sewing machine.
The Work Holder
consists of a movable jaw and spring
which holds the work firmly (in place of
the old method of pinning to the knee) and
without any risk of soiling or tearing the
finest fabric. The Thread Cutter is a small,
sharp, steel blade attached to the top of
Work Holder in such a manner that, while
its edge is protected, it is in the most convenient
position for use in cutting the
thread. The two wires are for holding the
spools, and are to be screwed into the holes
on each side of the needle cushion (as
shown in engraving). The thumb screw is
made long, to permit the "Assistant" to be
attached to tables of different thicknesses.
Each "Assistant" is nicely packed in a
strong paper box. Price 35 cents.</p>

<h2>"DILIGENT IN BUSINESS."</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IF there ever was a boy who needed to
turn over a new leaf and write at the
top as a motto, "Diligent in business,"
that boy was Howard Grinnell.</div>

<p>If his mother asked him to do anything, he
always replied, "I will in a minute." He said
this so often that I wonder he was not called
"in a minute" by everybody. It would have
been a very appropriate name.</p>

<p>Howard had the charge of the hens, at least
that was the way they put it, but I think that
Mrs. Grinnell was the one upon whom the
burden rested. Every morning after breakfast
she found it necessary to ask,</p>

<p>"Howard, have you fed the hens?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, but I am going to."</p>

<p>"Well, go right away, or you will forget it."</p>

<p>"No, I will not forget, I am going in a minute;
I just want to look at the weather report."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Howard appears from the
direction of the east meadow with his hands full
of meadow lilies which he presents to his mother,
saying:</p>

<p>"The very first! Put them in the antique
vase, please. And set it under the mantle, will
you, mamma?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, dear, they are beautiful! I will
arrange them at once." Then as she turned
away, "The hens?"</p>

<p>"O, I forgot! I'll go now."</p>

<p>"Seems to me," said Mr. Grinnell one morning,
"that you have carried that on your shoulders
about long enough. Howard should attend
to his business without prompting. It did very
well at first, but the time has come when he
must be held responsible for the prompt discharge
of the duty, else take away the privilege.
Howard!"</p>

<p>"Sir?" responded the boy, turning back on
his way to the barn.</p>

<p>"After this you are not to be reminded of
your work, and if the hens are not cared for before
breakfast, I will do it myself, and you will
not have any benefit from the eggs, either in
money or as food; it will be some little extra
trouble for your mother, but you will be provided
with food prepared without eggs unless you are
faithful to your trust."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir." And Howard went on his way.
I do not think he made any resolutions; he
thought it would be easy enough to attend to the
duty as required, and gave himself up to the examination
of a weed which had sprung up in the
yard and which was a new one to him. The
next morning he remembered the hens, but the
second morning though remembering he thought
of something he wished to hunt up in the cyclopædia,
and stopped in the library until the
breakfast bell rang.</p>

<p>For breakfast there was ham and eggs, and
corn muffins. Howard was a little surprised
when his father passed him a plate with only a
potato on it. He was about to remonstrate,
when he caught the significant look on his
mother's face, and remembered the compact.
He wisely made the best of it and decided that
he would try a bowl of bread and milk.</p>

<p>After breakfast Mr. Grinnell fed the hens, and
at night he brought in the eggs, saying to his
wife:</p>

<p>"I would like some boiled eggs for supper;
as Bridget is away, we can get along very well
with bread and butter and eggs. Didn't I see
you making a sponge cake this morning?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Then they both laughed, but Mr.
Grinnell sobered immediately and said:</p>

<p>"It is rather hard on the boy when he is so
fond of eggs, but it is quite time he had a lesson.
His dilatory habits will be a hindrance
to his success as long as he lives unless he is
cured."</p>

<p>Now, privately, I do not believe that Mr. or
Mrs. Grinnell enjoyed their supper of boiled eggs
and sponge cake. I know the mother would
much rather have eaten dry bread and given the
boy her supper, but she and her husband chatted
over the meal as if everything were quite as
usual. Howard ate his bread and butter, missing
the canned fruit which Mrs. Grinnell remarked
she thought they could do without as
they had the extra indulgence of boiled eggs.
Now I do not suppose any of you boys are surprised
to hear that Howard, after asking to be
excused some time before his father and mother
were through with their supper, banged the door
slightly as he left the room.</p>

<p>However, the next morning the hens received
attention at the proper time. And so far as that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
one duty was concerned he did not need another
lesson, but he was not yet made over into the
prompt boy which his father desired him to be.
That woodbox! O, boys! Do you shrug your
shoulders and say, "I don't blame him?" The
woodbox is a dread to boys, I well know. Howard
Grinnell did not particularly dislike the work
of filling the box, but he was never quite ready
to do it. He was always putting it off until he
had finished reading the morning paper, or been
the rounds of the garden and meadows to see
if there were any new flowers out or any new
birds' nests, and at length the school bell would
ring and he would go off to school having forgotten
that there was such a thing in the wide
world as a woodbox. One morning Mrs. Grinnell
said, "Howard, Bridget will need a box full
of wood to-day; she has a large ironing."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," said Howard dreamily from
the depths of an arm-chair where he had established
himself with a new orchid and a botany.
Mrs. Grinnell was busy, and gave the matter no
farther attention until two hours later Bridget
announced that the wood was out.</p>

<p>"Dear me!" said Mrs. Grinnell, "that boy
went off without filling the box, after all!"
After a moment's thought she said: "Well,
Bridget, Howard cannot expect his clothes to be
ironed with cold irons. You may hang all his
things upon the bars without ironing, and he
will have to wear them so. Perhaps you and I
can get wood enough for the rest."</p>

<p>Bridget thought it a good joke to play upon
Master Howard, and her good nature returned
in view of the sport she would have at the boy's
expense.</p>

<p>You may imagine that Howard did not enjoy
wearing his rough-dried garments, but he was
forced to do so. And as he was a somewhat
fastidious boy, it was quite a trial to go to school
in that plight.</p>

<p>It was by such lessons as this that Mr. and
Mrs. Grinnell sought to cure Howard of his
fault; and one day when Mrs. Grinnell was looking
over same mottoes, she discovered one
handsomely illuminated which struck her as
being just the one for her son's room. It was
this:</p>

<p>"Diligent in business, serving the Lord!"</p>

<h2>HOW IT BECAME POSSIBLE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"THAT is impossible!" and Mrs. Frazee
turned away to hide the tears that were
ready to fall. The doctor had just said,
"I must tell you plainly, she has no
chance for life here; she can never get
through the spring months in this stifled air.
If you take her into the country at once I have
not the slightest doubt of complete recovery;
she is sure to rally with fresh air and country
living. She ought to go at once."</div>

<p>And to this Mrs. Frazee had made answer,
"It is impossible!" and indeed it did seem impossible.
Where was the money to come from
for a journey?</p>

<p>Annie Frazee had been ill all winter; first it
was the measles, then later the whooping-cough.
How that cough did hang on! Day after day
the child seemed to grow weaker, though they
kept hoping for improvement. They were too
poor to have constant medical attendance, but a
kind-hearted physician who had been consulted
when the cough had proved too obstinate to
yield to the mother's nursing, had fallen into
the habit of dropping in for a moment whenever
he was in the neighborhood. It was one of
those bright mornings of early spring. Doctor
Emmons had been called to prescribe for Mrs.
Murphy's baby. Mrs. Murphy lived away up
at the top of the tall tenement house of which
the Frazees occupied two rooms on the second
floor. The doctor stopped for a few moments
on his way down, and his quick professional eye
noted immediately the change in Annie since
his last call, and he made the plain statement
which so distressed the poor mother.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 351px;">
<img src="images/illus011.jpg" width="351" height="484" alt="cottage with flower pots on sill outside" />
<div class="caption">ANNIE'S WINDOW.</div>
</div>

<p>"If it could be," she said over and over when
Doctor Emmons had gone on his busy way,
"but it is impossible!"</p>

<p>Suddenly as she was going sadly about taking
up the work she must do, and repeating the sorrowful
sentence, "It is impossible!" she seemed
to hear a voice saying, "The things which are
impossible with men, are possible with God."</p>

<p>The voice seemed far away, and though Mrs.
Frazee was startled she soon realized that it was
a memory of words she had read long ago, and
as she reflected she knew that they were the
words of Christ himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Away back in her girlhood Mrs. Frazee had
professed to be a follower of Jesus. The good
seed sown in her heart in the Sunday-school
seemed to promise to bring forth fruit; but
presently the pleasures of life, and afterwards
the cares, crowded in upon her Christian life,
until it seemed to have withered away. Dropping
Christian duties one by one, putting away
the privileges of a servant of God, she had for a
long time been living away from Christ, struggling
under her sorrows without aid from above.
And that morning along with the memory of the
words, "With God all things are possible," came
the thought, "But this is not for me! I cannot
claim anything from God; I have so long
wandered from Christ, so long denied my
Master that I have no right to come in his name
asking for help!" Then after a little while
thoughts of the prodigal came to her, and then
by and by, stepping softly so as not to disturb
Annie who had fallen into a light sleep, and saying
in a whisper so faint that only the ear of the
Infinite could hear, "I will arise and go to my
Father," she passed into the other room, and,
closing the door, knelt down alone
with God to confess her sin and
to plead for forgiveness. When
did Christ ever turn away from a
weary, burdened and repentant
soul?</p>

<p>When Mrs. Frazee came back
to the room where Annie was still
sleeping, and looked into the pale
face, she murmured, "If it be thy
will, dear Father, spare my child."
The possibility of bringing about a
removal of her darling into the
country seemed as remote as ever.
Yet now and then there came the
thought, "With God all things are
possible!"</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a pleasant home in the upper
part of the city a cheerful group sat
at breakfast.</p>

<p>"If I go home with uncle Ben, I
have ever so much to do to-day,"
said Ethel Miller, a bright young
girl of fifteen.</p>

<p>"You girls always have so much
to do," replied her brother John,
two years younger. "I could get
ready to go into the country for a
few days in five minutes, but I suppose
you will have to spend half
a day deciding what to take, and
the other half in packing two or
three trunks!" he added with a smile.</p>

<p>"You are quite mistaken; I am not going to
take even one trunk. But I have some calls to
make."</p>

<p>"Calls!" said uncle Ben, arching his eyebrows.
"I supposed that as you were a schoolgirl
yet, you were exempt from that form of
fashionable nonsense."</p>

<p>"Oh! I do not mean fashionable calls," replied
Ethel; "but you see I am on the lookout<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
committee, and Mr. Myers told me yesterday
that the Frazee girl who has been sick all winter
seems to be failing, and I ought to go there before
I go away. And there are one or two more
on my list who live down that way, so I may as
well call on them all while I am about it."</p>

<p>"What will you do this morning, Benjamin?"
asked Mr. William Miller, Ethel's father.</p>

<p>"If Ethel will take me along, I think I will go
with her, and on the way back I will drop in at
the store and go to lunch with you. And this
afternoon I propose to give myself over to
John."</p>

<p>This arrangement gave general satisfaction,
only Mrs. Miller suggested that she, being left
out of the plans, should claim the evening for
herself.</p>

<p>Several things happened to delay Ethel and
uncle Ben, so that it was quite a little after noon
when they reached the home of the Frazees.
Ethel in her new spring suit, with her dainty
ways and bright face, was a pleasant sight to the
invalid, and uncle Ben seemed to Mrs. Frazee
to bring in a whiff of that country air which she
had been longing for.</p>

<p>It all came about naturally enough. Ethel's
inquiries brought out the information that Annie
was not gaining and that the doctor had recommended
country air. And Mrs. Frazee said,
"We have not had time to plan yet, but I hope
a way will be opened for her to go, though it
seems just now to be impossible."</p>

<p>Uncle Ben listened, meantime taking in the
barenness of the room as to its furnishings.
Presently he asked a few questions, not in any
sense obtrusive, but such as a sympathetic
stranger might ask if he knew how, and uncle
Ben did know how. Then he said, turning to
Ethel: "Suppose we take your friend here home
with us? There's room enough out there, and
your aunt would not let her want for care."</p>

<p>Ethel's eyes beamed. "That would be just
the thing! May we take her, Mrs. Frazee?"
Then Ethel explained that uncle Ben lived about
forty miles away in the country, that she was
going home with him for a week, and that Annie
would be a very welcome guest if she could go.</p>

<p>"You see," said Mr. Benjamin Miller, "if it
agrees with her out there she can stay on after
Ethel comes back to school; Ethel being with
her for the first few days will help her to get
used to the place."</p>

<p>Mrs. Frazee was too much overcome to express
her joy at this unexpected turn of affairs.
She tried to say it was too much, that they were
strangers to him, and could not expect such
kindness; but uncle Ben said:</p>

<p>"It's all right! This seems to be the next
bit of work that the Lord has set for me to do,
and it is not an unpleasant task, I'm thinking.
Someway he gives me pleasant things to do,
mostly!"</p>

<p>So it was settled, and a week later Mrs.
Frazee's heart was cheered by a letter from
Annie herself. She wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">My Dear Mamma</span>:</div>

<p>I am getting stronger every day. It is lovely here. The
house is the prettiest I ever saw, and my room is just as cunning
as it can be. A pair of birds are building a nest under the eaves
close to my window. Mrs. Miller brought up some plants in
pots for my window. Before Miss Ethel went away she went
down the river to where the pussy willows grow and brought
me some catkins. Mr. Miller is going to take me out for a ride
this afternoon. I have all the milk I can drink, and I do not
cough at all nights. I wiped the dishes for Mrs. Miller this
morning. So you may know I am better.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Annie.</span><br />
</div></blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Frazee dropped the letter in her lap, and
clasping her hands said, "My God, I thank
thee!" Presently Doctor Emmons tapped at
the door, and entering, looked about in surprise.</p>

<p>"What have you done with my patient?"</p>

<p>"O doctor! didn't you know? She has gone
into the country and I have a letter here from
her. She is getting well!"</p>

<p>"Of course she is! But how did it happen?"
And then Mrs. Frazee had to tell the story to
the wondering doctor. As she ended she added,
"And I have found out that 'all things are possible
with God.'"</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>IN came the children, one evening when they
were to have a story, and Rollo laid the
verses in Grandma Burton's lap. The room
looked very pretty that evening. There was a
bright coal fire burning in the grate, which
lighted everything beautifully, and Grandma
herself was the prettiest object in it. So the
children thought, anyway.</div>

<p>"Yes," she said, "I know a story about that
last one. It happened a great many years ago,
as the most of my stories do. Are you all
ready?"</p>

<p>The hassock and chairs were by this time
fixed in their accustomed places, and the silence
kept by all the children showed that they were
ready for the story, without Harold's announcement
to that effect. So Grandma began:</p>

<p>"It was one day in November, just before
Thanksgiving, when I was about twelve years
old, that my brother Fred and I received a note
from a lady who lived out in the country a mile
or two, which said that she wanted us to come
and spend Thanksgiving with her. We were
both very fond of Mrs. Watson, and were delighted
when father said we might go.</p>

<p>"So that afternoon he harnessed Old Gray to
the sleigh, and took us around to Mrs. Watson's.
It was quite cold, I remember, and father said
he guessed there would be a big snowstorm in
the night. The house we were going to was a
little low one, that was old-fashioned even then,
and with only one story.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Watson came to the gate to meet us,
and showed us into her warm kitchen, while
father said good-by, and hurried home. We
had some nice fresh milk and bread for supper,
and went to bed early. I was very tired, and
didn't waken till I heard the big clock strike six,
so I hurried up, and dressed very fast, all the
time wondering what made the room so dark.
I couldn't see out of doors, because of the curtain
at the little window.</p>

<p>"When I came into the other room, I saw my
brother up on a chair at the window, looking
over what seemed to be a white sheet tacked to
it, and Mrs. Watson watching him. 'You can't
see anything but snow,' he said presently, 'for
the little hill hides the road.' 'Why, what is
the matter?' I asked, surprising them so that
Fred nearly fell off his chair. And how frightened
I was when I found the snow had drifted
against the house, so that we could neither see
out of the windows, nor get out of the door!</p>

<p>"My!" said Sarah. "Why, we never see so
much snow as that here, Grandma."</p>

<p>"I know, dear," said Grandma Burton, "but
where I lived when I was a little girl was much
farther North than we are now, you know, and
I remember that in the winters we often used to
go out sleighriding, and ride over the tops of the
fences, not being able to see them at all."</p>

<p>"What fun! Now go on, Grandma."</p>

<p>"Well, we tried to make a way through the
drift, but didn't succeed. My brother said he
thought he could shovel a path, but Mrs. Watson
told him she had lent her big shovel to Mr.
Smith the day before, while his was getting
mended, and had only a little one for the fire.
So all there was to do was to get breakfast, and
wait for some one to come and dig as out of the
drift, or rather, dig the drift away from us.</p>

<p>"We did pretty well for breakfast, only we
hadn't any bread. 'I was out of flour,' said
Mrs. Watson, 'before I knew it, and Mr. Jones
was to bring me another barrel this morning,
but I don't suppose he will come, now that there
is so much snow.' The turkey was there in the
pantry, so were the cranberries; Mrs. Watson
let Fred and me help cook them for dinner, and
we tried to make the best of our condition, and
think as little as possible of the great wall of
snow outside the house. But it was hard work;
every little while the tears would come into my
eyes, to think of my dear father and mother at
home, not knowing how we were snowed up in
the little red farmhouse.</p>

<p>"A little while after breakfast we all sat down
to have family worship, and Mrs. Watson, taking
down her big old Bible, read part of the
sixth chapter of John. I remember it now, just
as well as I did years ago, how she read about
Jesus' feeding that great multitude, when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
had nothing to eat. And then how he told his
disciples afterward what was the best bread to
have, and said, 'I am the bread of life: he that
cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that
believeth on me shall never thirst.'</p>

<p>"'Children,' said Mrs. Watson, when she had
finished reading, 'Jesus can give us the bread
we eat, and the bread of life, just as well now as
he could then. Let us ask him for the two
kinds.' And then we knelt down, and she
prayed very earnestly that God would not only
give us the bread that we needed then to eat,
but would also give us the blessed bread of life.
And I am sure Fred and I prayed too.</p>

<p>"The dinner was a pretty good one, with the
turkey and all, but we missed the bread again.
It is wonderful how much you do need that, no
matter what else you have. I had often thought,
before that Thanksgiving, that I could get along
just as well without bread as with it, if I had
plenty of other things, but I saw, in just that
one day, how necessary it was.</p>

<p>"We had a pretty lonely afternoon. Nearly
always, when we went to see Mrs. Watson, we
had a very good time, but with that great wall of
snow outside the house, and the weather growing
colder and colder, so that it couldn't melt, it was
impossible to be very happy, no matter how much
we tried. It seemed awful to go to bed feeling so
badly, though I knew that father would be after
us in the morning. Every little while, all the
afternoon, I would flatten my nose against the
window, and after looking at the snow a minute,
I would shut my eyes tight, and pray to God that
he would have somebody come and help us soon.
And I really thought he would answer.</p>

<p>"When supper time came, and the clock
struck six, we were all real glad, I guess, for we
hadn't eaten so very much for dinner, and were
pretty hungry; besides, supper would give us
something to do. But there wasn't much of it&mdash;no
bread, and no milk&mdash;only a little cold
turkey for each of us, for the coal was all gone,
and we couldn't cook anything. The room was
growing cold. I put mother's shawl around me,
and Fred put on his overcoat, while Mrs. Watson
got her shawl too. We had to light a
candle long before supper time, it got dark so
early, when only a little bit of light could come
in at the windows.</p>

<p>"So there we sat, in the cold kitchen. Once
or twice Mrs. Watson suggested that my brother
and I should go to bed, but he was sure he
didn't want to&mdash;neither did I. So she got out an
old game of checkers, and we played awhile, till
we grew sleepy in spite of ourselves, and I
dropped off into dreamland with my head on
Mrs. Watson's lap, and Fred with his on the
table. I didn't waken till the clock struck ten,
and then I sat up and looked about me in surprise.
I could hardly remember where I was,
when suddenly I heard a dull thud, which made
all of us jump.</p>

<p>"We opened the front door wide. Just as
we did so, a great mass of snow came into our
faces, soon a snow-shovel appeared, and next&mdash;the
face of my father! O, how glad we were!
He stepped into the room, and threw his arms
about Fred and me, covering us with a coating
of snow. Two or three more men came in then,
one of them with a basket which had been sent
by my mother, and as Mrs. Watson took off the
cover, I spied a huge piece of bread and butter,
and contented myself with that. You can't
think how good it was to have some bread again!
It seemed a year since I had had any!</p>

<p>"That's about all there is to tell, except that
in the morning father drove Fred and me home
in the sleigh, just as we had come. The reason
the verse made me think of that Thanksgiving
was that I had never before realized how valuable
and necessary bread was, and why Jesus
called himself 'the bread of life.'</p>

<p>"My brother told me, a great many years
later, that he believed that day was the first time
he ever really made up his mind to come to the
'Bread of life,' and never hunger again."</p>

<p>"Why didn't they come sooner?" asked Rollo.</p>

<p>"They didn't know Mrs. Watson's house was
snowed up so. It was out in the country, you
know, and the snow hadn't drifted so badly in
the town. But they missed us from meeting in
the morning, and in the afternoon a man came
into town, and told them he had seen the house
with the wall of snow all around it. So they got
their shovels, and came right out to help us."</p>

<p>"I think it was dreadful!" said Marion.</p>

<p>"But God was taking care of us, dearie," said
Grandma, "and he heard and answered our
prayers."</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-y.jpg" width="76" height="88" alt="Y" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"YOU see," said Jerry, as Nettie came, protesting
as she walked that she could stay
but a few minutes, because there was
Norm's collar, and she had four nice
apples out of which she was going to make some
splendid apple dumplings for dinner, "you
see we must contrive something to keep a young
fellow like Norm busy, if we are going to hold
him after he is caught. It doesn't do to catch
a fish and leave him on the edge of the bank
near enough to flounce himself back into the
water. Norm ought to be set to work to help
along the plans, and kept so busy that he
wouldn't have time to get tired of them."</div>

<p>"But how could that be done?" Nettie said
in wondering tones, which nevertheless had a
note of admiration in them. Jerry went so
deeply into things, it almost took her breath
away to follow him.</p>

<p>"Just so; that's the problem which ought to
be thought out. I can think of things enough;
but the room, and the tools to begin with, are
the trouble."</p>

<p>"What have you thought of? What would
you do if you could?"</p>

<p>"O my!" said Jerry, with a little laugh;
"don't ask me that question, or your folks will
have no apple dumplings to-day. I don't believe
there is any end to the things which I would do
if I could. But the first beginnings of them are
like this: suppose we had a few dollars capital,
and a room."</p>

<p>"You might as well suppose we had a palace,
and a million dollars," said Nettie, with a long-drawn
sigh.</p>

<p>"No, because I don't expect either of those
things; but I do mean to have a room and a few
dollars in capital for this thing some day; only,
you see, I don't want to wait for them."</p>

<p>"Well, go on; what then?"</p>

<p>"Why, then we would start an eating-house,
you and I, on a little bit of a scale, you know.
We would have bread with some kind of meat
between, and coffee, in cold weather, and lemonade
in hot, and a few apples, and now and then
some nuts, and a good deal of gingerbread&mdash;soft,
like what auntie Smith makes&mdash;and some
ginger-snaps like those Mrs. Dix sent us from
the country, and, well, you know the names of
things better than I do. Real good things, I
mean, but which don't cost much. Such as you,
and Sarah Ann, and a good many bright girls
learn how to make, without using a great deal
of money. Those things are all rather cheap,
which I have mentioned, because we have them
at our house quite often, and the Smiths are
poor, you know. But they are made so nice
that they are just capital. Well, I would have
them for sale, just as cheap as could possibly be
afforded; a great deal cheaper than beer, or
cigars, and I would have the room bright and
cheery; warm in winter, and as cool as I could
make it in summer; then I would have slips of
paper scattered about the town, inviting young
folks to come in and get a lunch; then when
they came, I would have picture papers if I
could, for them to look at, and games to play,
real nice jolly games, and some kind of music
going on now and then. I'd run opposition to
that old grocery around the corner from Crossman's,
with its fiddle and its whiskey. That's
the beginning of what I would do. Just what
I told you about, that first night we talked it
over. The fellows, lots of them, have nowhere
to go; it keeps growing in my mind, the need
for doing something of the sort. I never pass
that mean grocery without thinking of it."</p>

<p>You should have seen Nettie's eyes! The little
touch of discouragement was gone out of
them, and they were full of intense thought.</p>

<p>"I can see," she said at last, "just how splendid
it might grow to be. But what did you
mean about Norm? there isn't any work for
him in such a plan. At least, I mean, not until
he was interested to help for the sake of others."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is, plenty of business for him.
Don't you see? I would have this room open
evenings, after the work was done, and I would
have Norm head manager. He should wait
on customers, and keep accounts. When the
thing got going he would be as busy as a bee;
and he is just the sort of fellow to do that kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
of thing well, and like it too," he added.</p>

<p>"O Jerry," said Nettie, and her hands were
clasped so closely that the blood flowed back
into her wrists, "was there ever a nicer thought
than that in the world! I know it would succeed;
and Norm would like it so much. Norm
likes to do things for others, if he only had the
chance."</p>

<p>"I know it; and he likes to do things in a
business way, and keep everything straight.
Oh! he would be just the one. If we only had
a room, there is nothing to hinder our beginning
in a very small way. Those chickens are growing
as fast as they can, and by Thanksgiving
there will be a couple of them ready to broil;
then the little old grandmothers did so well."</p>

<p>"I know it; who would have supposed that
almost four dollars could be made out of some
daisy grandmothers! Miss Sherrill gave me
one dollar and ninety-five cents which she said
was just half of what they had earned. I do
think it was so nice in her to give us that
chance! She couldn't have known how much
we wanted the money. Jerry, why couldn't we
begin, just with that? It would start us, and
then if the things sold, why, the money from
them would keep us started until we found a
way to earn more. Why can't we?"</p>

<p>"Room," said Jerry, with commendable
brevity. "Why, we have a room; there's the
front one that we just put in such nice order.
Why not? It is large enough for now, and
maybe when our business grew we could get
another one somehow."</p>

<p>Jerry stopped fitting the toe of his boot to a
hole which he had made in the ground, and
looked at the eager young woman of business
before him. "Do you mean your mother would
let us have the room, and the chance in the
kitchen, to go into such business?"</p>

<p>"Mother would do <i>anything</i>," said Nettie
emphatically, "anything in the world which
might possibly keep Norm in the house evenings;
you don't know how dreadfully she feels
about Norm. She thinks father," and there
Nettie stopped. How could a daughter put it
into words that her mother was afraid her father
would lead his son astray?</p>

<p>"I know," said Jerry. "See here, Nettie,
what is the matter with your father? I never
saw him look so still, and&mdash;well, queer, in some
way. Mr. Smith says he doesn't think he is
drinking a drop; but he looks unlike himself,
somehow, and I can't decide how."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Nettie, in a low voice.
"We don't know what to think of him. He
hasn't been so long without drinking, mother
says, in four years. But he doesn't act right;
or, I mean, natural. He isn't cross, as drinking
beer makes him, but he isn't pleasant, as he was
for a day or two. He is real sober; hardly
speaks at all, nor notices the things I make; and
I try just as hard to please him! He eats
everything, but he does it as though he didn't
know he was eating. Mother thinks he is in
some trouble, but she can't tell what. He can't
be afraid of losing his place&mdash;because mother
says he was threatened that two or three times
when he was drinking so hard, and he didn't
seem to mind it at all; and why should he be
discharged now, when he works hard every day?
Last Saturday night he brought home more
money than he has in years. Mother cried when
she saw what there was, but she had debts to
pay, so we didn't get much start out of it after
all. Then we spend a good deal in coffee; we
have it three times a day, hot and strong; I can
see father seems to need it; and I have heard
that it helped men who were trying not to drink.
When I told mother that, she said he should
have it if she had to beg for it on her knees.
But I don't know what is the matter with father
now. Sometimes mother is afraid there is a
disease coming on him such as men have who
drink; she says he doesn't sleep very well nights,
and he groans some, when he is asleep. Mother
tries hard," said Nettie, in a closing burst of
confidence, "and she <i>does</i> have such a hard time!
If we could only save Norm for her."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you who your mother looks like, or
would look like if she were dressed up, you
know. Did you ever see Mrs. Burt?"</p>

<p>"The woman who lives in the cottage where
the vines climb all around the front, and who
has birds, and a baby? I saw her yesterday.
You don't think mother looks like her!"</p>

<p>"She would," said Jerry, positively, "if she
had on a pink and white dress and a white fold
about her neck. I passed there last night, while
Mrs. Burt was sitting out by that window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
garden of hers, with her baby in her arms; Mr.
Burt sat on one of the steps, and they were talking
and laughing together. I could not help
noticing how much like your mother she looked
when she turned her side face. Oh! she is
younger, of course; she looks almost as though
she might be your mother's daughter. I was
thinking what fun it would be if she were, and
we could go and visit her, and get her to help
us about all sorts of things. Mr. Burt knows
how to do every kind of work about building a
house, or fixing up a room."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 416px;">
<img src="images/illus027.jpg" width="416" height="459" alt="man working on window box looking back at woman and baby " />
<div class="caption">THE BURT COTTAGE.</div>
</div>

<p>"He is a nice man, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, nice enough; he is steady and
works hard. Mr. Smith thinks he is quite a
pattern; he has bought that little house where
he lives, and fixed it all up with vines and things;
but I should like him better if he didn't puff
tobacco smoke into his wife's face when he talked
with her. He doesn't begin to be so good a
workman as your father, nor to know so much
in a hundred ways. I think your father is a very
nice-looking man when he is dressed up. He looks
smart, and he is smart. Mr. Smith says there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
isn't a man in town who can do the sort of work
that he can at the shop, and that he could get
very high wages and be promoted and all that,
if"&mdash;</p>

<p>Jerry stopped suddenly, and Nettie finished
the sentence with a sigh. She too had passed
the Burt cottage and admired its beauty and
neatness. To think that Mr. Burt owned it, and
was a younger man by fifteen years at least than
her father&mdash;and was not so good a workman!
then see how well he dressed his wife; and little
Bobby Burt looked as neat and pretty in
Sunday-school as the best of them. It was very
hard that there must be such a difference in
homes. If she could only live in a house like
the Burt cottage, and have things nice about
her as they did, and have her father and mother
sit together and talk, as Mr. and Mrs. Burt did,
she should be perfectly happy, Nettie told herself.
Then she sprang up from the log and declared
that she must not waste another minute
of time; but that Jerry's plan was the best one
she had ever heard, and she believed they could
begin it.</p>

<p>With this thought still in mind, after the dinner
dishes were carefully cleared away, and her
mother, returned from the day's ironing, had
been treated to a piece of the apple dumpling
warmed over for her, and had said it was as nice
a bit as she ever tasted, Nettie began on the
subject which had been in her thoughts all day:</p>

<p>"What would you think of us young folks going
into business?"</p>

<p>"Going into business!"</p>

<p>"Yes'm. Jerry and Norm and me. Jerry
has a plan; he has been telling me about it this
morning. It is nice if we can only carry it out;
and I shouldn't wonder if we could. That is, if
you think well of it."</p>

<p>"I begin to think there isn't much that you
and Jerry can't do, with Norm, or with anybody
else, if you try; and you both appear to be ready
to try to do all you can for everybody."</p>

<p>Mrs. Decker's tone was so hearty and pleased,
that you would not have known her for the same
woman who looked forward dismally but a few
weeks ago to Nettie's home-coming. Her heart
had so warmed to the girl in her efforts for
father and brother, that she was almost ready to
agree to anything which she could have to propose.
So Nettie, well pleased with this beginning,
unfolded with great clearness and detail,
Jerry's wonderful plan for not only catching
Norm, but setting him up in business.</p>

<p>Mrs. Decker listened, and questioned and
cross-questioned, sewing swiftly the while on
Norm's jacket which had been torn, and which
was being skilfully darned in view of the evening
to be spent at the parsonage.</p>

<p>"Well," she said at last, "it looks wild to me,
I own; I should as soon try to fly, as of making
anything like that work in this town; but then,
you've made things work, you two, that I'd no
notion could be done, and between you, you
seem to kind of bewitch Norm. He's done
things for you that I would no sooner have
thought of asking of him than I would have asked
him to fly up to the moon; and this may be
another of them. Anyhow, if you've a mind to
try it, I won't be the one to stop you. I've been
that scared for Norm, that I'm ready for anything.
Oh! the <i>room</i>, of course you may use it.
If you wanted to have a circus in there, I think
I'd agree, wild animals and all; I've had worse
than wild animals in my day. No, your father
won't object; he thinks what you do is about
right, I guess. And for the matter of that, he
doesn't object to anything nowadays; I don't
know what to make of him."</p>

<p>The sentence ended with a long-drawn,
troubled sigh.</p>

<p>Just what this strange change in her husband
meant, Mrs. Decker could not decide; and each
theory which she started in her mind about it,
looked worse than the last.</p>

<p>Norm's collar was ready for him, so was his
jacket. He was somewhat surly; the truth was,
he had received what he called a "bid" to the
merry-making which was to take place in the
back room of the grocery, around the corner
from Crossman's, and he was a good deal tried
to think he had cut himself off by what he
called a "spooney" promise, from enjoying the
evening there. At the same time there was a
certain sense of largeness in saying he could not
come because he had received an invitation
elsewhere, which gave him a momentary pleasure.
To be sure the boys coaxed until they had
discovered the place of his engagement, and
joked him the rest of the time, until he was half-inclined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
to wish he had never heard of the parsonage;
but for all that, a certain something in
Norman which marked him as different from
some boys, held him to his word when it was
passed; and he had no thought of breaking from
his engagement. It was an evening such as
Norman had reason to remember. For the first
time in his life he sat in a pleasantly furnished
home, among ladies and gentlemen, and heard
himself spoken to as one who "belonged."</p>

<p>Three ladies were there from the city, and two
gentlemen whom Norman had never seen before;
all friends of the Sherrills come out to
spend a day with them. They were not only
unlike any people whom he had ever seen before,
but, if he had known it, unlike a great many
ladies and gentlemen, in that their chief aim in
life was to be found in their Master's service;
and a boy about whom they knew nothing, save
that he was poor, and surrounded by temptations,
and Satan desired to have him, was in
their eyes so much stray material which they
were bound to bring back to the rightful owner
if they could.</p>

<p>To this end they talked to Norman. Not in
the form of a lecture, but with bright, winning
words, on topics which he could understand,
not only, but actually on certain topics about
which he knew more than they! For instance,
there was a cave about two miles from the town,
of which they had heard, but had never seen;
and Norm had explored every crevice in it many
a time. He knew on which side of the river it
was located, whether the entrance was from the
east or the south; just how far one could walk
through it, just how far one could creep in it,
after walking had become impossible, and a
dozen other things which it had not occurred to
him were of interest to anybody else. In fact,
Norm discovered in the course of the hour that
there was such a thing as conversation. Not
that he made use of that word, in thinking it
over; his thoughts, if they could have been seen,
would have been something like this: "These
are swell folks, but I can understand what they
say, and they seem to understand what I say,
and don't stare as though I was a wild animal
escaped from the woods. I wonder what makes
the difference between them and other folks?"</p>

<p>But when the music began! I have no words
to describe to you what it was to Norm to sit
close to an organ and hear its softest notes, and
feel the thrill of its heavy bass tones, and be appealed
to occasionally as to whether he liked
this or that the best, and to have a piece sung
because the player thought it would please him;
she selected it that morning, she told him, with
this thought in view.</p>

<p>"Decker, you ought to learn to play," said one
of the guests who had watched him through the
last piece. "You <i>look</i> music, right out of your
eyes. Miss Sherrill, here is a pupil for you who
might do you credit. Have you ever had any
instrument, Decker?"</p>

<p>Then Norm came back to every-day life, and
flushed and stammered. "No, he hadn't, and
was not likely to;" and wondered what they
would think if they were to see the corner
grocery where he spent most of his leisure
time.</p>

<p>The questioner laughed pleasantly. "Oh, I'm
not so sure of that. I have a friend who plays
the violin in a way to bring tears to people's
eyes, and he never touched one until he was
thirty years old; hadn't time until then. He
was an apprentice, and had his trade to master,
and himself to get well started in it before he
had time for music; but when he came to leisure,
he made music a delight to himself and
to others."</p>

<p>"A great deal can be done with leisure time,"
said another of the guests. "Mr. Sherrill, you
remember Myers, your college classmate? He
did not learn to read, you know, until he was
seventeen."</p>

<p>"What?" said Norm, astonished out of his
diffidence; "didn't know how to read!"</p>

<p>"No," repeated the gentleman, "not until he
was seventeen. He had a hard childhood&mdash;was
kicked about in the world, with no leisure and
no help, had to work evenings as well as days,
but when he was seventeen he fell into kinder
hands, and had a couple of hours each evening
all to himself, and he mastered reading, not
only, but all the common studies, and graduated
from college with honor when he was twenty-six."</p>

<p>Now Norm had all his evenings to lounge
about in, and had not known what to do with
them; and he could read quite well.</p>

<h2>THE TWO LITTLE PIGS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>ONE bright summer morning as I was strolling
toward the beach, on the island of
Mackinac, I saw a short distance ahead of me,
two little pigs, one perfectly white and the other
perfectly black, both the same size, trudging
along side by side in the same direction as myself,
seemingly engaged in earnest conversation.
They seemed so out of place, and I was so
curious to know whither they were bound, that
I followed them unobserved.</div>

<p>They did not walk aimlessly, but as if they
had some special object in view, and some definite
destination. I wondered what they would
do when they reached the water. I was not long
in being answered. Without a moment's hesitation,
they plunged into the waves, side by side,
and swam out and away toward another island,
six miles distant. I stood and watched them
until their two little heads looked like balls
bobbing up and down, side by side all the time.</p>

<p>When I related the incident to the landlord,
a little later, he looked astonished and annoyed.</p>

<p>"Those pigs," he said, "were to have been
served up for dinner to-day. They were brought
here this morning in a boat from that island, six
miles away, and we thought we might allow
them their freedom for the short time they had
to live, never thinking of their making an attempt
to return home. And did you notice," he
continued, "they chose the point of land nearest
the island where they came from, to enter the
water? Singular, the little animals should have
been so bright? And, furthermore, they weren't
landed there; that makes it more strange."</p>

<p>I, too, left the island that day, and I have
never heard whether those brave little pigs ever
reached their destination or not.&mdash;<i>Harper's

<h2>DECORATION DAY.</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
YES, little daughter, we go again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One glad bright hour in May,</span><br />
To cover with bloom the quiet graves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where sleep the "Blue and Gray."</span><br />
<br />
I think I have told you many times<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sacred reason why,</span><br />
But mamma often likes to speak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the sad, sad days gone by.</span><br />
<br />
I have told you how your grandpa<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fell in the ranks of the Blue,</span><br />
When I was a wee maid, Barbara,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not nearly as large as you.</span><br />
<br />
Fell 'neath the dear old banner<br />
At the battle of "Cedar Creek,"<br />
In the days when uncle Charley<br />
Was a baby small and weak.<br />
<br />
I well remember him, darling,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So true, and noble, and bold,</span><br />
Though I was such a small, small girlie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Not quite turned eight years old.</span><br />
<br />
He told me we of the Northland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Were forced to enter the fight,</span><br />
How <i>we</i>, not our Southern brother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were battling for God and right,</span><br />
<br />
How they of the fiery Southland<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were striving to tear apart</span><br />
The States cemented by life-blood,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">From many a loyal heart.</span><br />
<br />
And I ever was staunchly loyal,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For when my baby came,</span><br />
I called her the name our Quaker bard<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has given to deathless fame.</span><br />
<br />
Of her who so bravely held the flag,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Out in the morning air</span><br />
Baring to rebel bullets<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The crown of her grand white hair.</span><br />
<br />
But grandpa dwells where he knows to-day<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The truth between Gray and Blue</span><br />
Better than they of that far-off time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who thought they alone were true,</span><br />
<br />
And mamma has learned that noble men<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Were there on the conquered side,</span><br />
As any that ever suffered,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Suffered and bravely died.</span><br />
<br />
So, little maiden Barbara,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On that sunny time in May,</span><br />
Let us seek to honor the lonely graves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the men who wore the Gray.</span><br />

<h2>MONUMENTS.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i2.jpg" width="70" height="117" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IT was my first visit to New York. A
few days after my arrival uncle took me
to Greenwood, the most beautiful cemetery
I ever saw. We visited the many
points of interest. As we stood gazing
at the fireman's monument, uncle told me the
story of his heroism; how in one of the fierce
fires this brave man lost his life while rescuing
a woman from the flames. Then we spent a
long time looking at the monument to Miss
Conda, the beautiful young heiress who was
thrown from a carriage and killed; and her
fortune was built up in this wonderful marble.</div>

<p>The next morning aunt said, "You will go
with me to-day to another Greenwood and see
grander monuments than any you saw yesterday."</p>

<p>I wondered how that could be. But we were
soon on our way. At length we turned into
narrow, dirty streets, growing worse and worse.
I shuddered at such sights and sounds of human
beings, never before dreaming that in grand
New York there could be so much wretchedness.
I drew closer and closer to aunt, fearing one of
the human demons that leered at us would seize
me and carry me off.</p>

<p>Such people! such places to live in! Such
language! Why, it almost makes my hair stand
on end to think of it. Aunt did not seem to mind
them. May be they knew her, for every one
stood aside for us to pass. "Here it is," she
said at length. "Here is the other Greenwood."</p>

<p>"This?" I answered, looking around for gravestones
and monuments, and seeing nothing but
dreadful houses and miserable objects. "This
Greenwood!"</p>

<p>She simply answered, "Yes; come right in
and you shall see the monuments."</p>

<p>I could only follow, wondering all the while if
aunt was not losing her mind.</p>

<p>A sweet-faced girl met us with a warm welcome
to aunt and an earnest look at me. As she
led the way within, aunt whispered:</p>

<p>"One of the monuments, Clara."</p>

<p>"What? I don't know what you mean."</p>

<p>"Her name is Maggie," she quickly whispered
back; "used to be called 'wild Maggie;' was one
of the worst girls in this region. Never mind
now, will tell you more hereafter. Take a good
look at her, you'll see her again."</p>

<p>Then I heard singing like the songs of many
angels. A door swung open. We entered.
It was a great company of children, black and
white, some with sweet sad faces; others with
evil looks, but all singing. Soon Maggie came
in from another door and sat among them and I
could hear her voice ring out in joyful strains,
leading the rest.</p>

<p>There was prayer and Bible reading, and
such a good talk by a gentleman. It seemed
like heaven, while many of the children, some
partly blind, some lame, some pale and sad-faced,
gathered around after meeting was out and
seized aunt Joanna's hand, and seemed so happy.
Another lady was there to whom they all pressed
for a smile and a word.</p>

<p>"That lady," said aunt, "is Sir Christopher
Wren."</p>

<p>"What <i>can</i> you mean?" I asked. "Sir
Christopher Wren was a <i>man</i> who died in England
more than a hundred years ago."</p>

<p>Aunt Joanna only laughed and said, "And
came to life again, my child. This is he, only
greater."</p>

<p>"What?" said I, more and more bewildered.</p>

<p>But she went on: "Look around here at the
Monuments. You knew Sir Christopher was
the architect of the great Westminster Abbey
of London, and that kings and statesmen and
poets are buried there, and their names and
deeds are written there; but if any one inquires
for Sir Christopher Wren's monument, he is told
to look at the wonderful building of which he
was the architect."</p>

<p>"I see," said I, "that lady has 'built up'
Maggie."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said aunt Joanna, "and more than
one hundred other miserable, sick and wicked
children. See that frail girl over there coming
toward her? It would take a book to tell how
this lady used to come daily here and bend over
her crib, sometimes holding her in her arms for
hours fearing each moment would be her last.
But come and I will introduce you and you shall
see a greater than Christopher Wren."</p>

<p>After we were on our way home, aunt told
me the story of this lady; how one day curiosity
led her to go through this worst part of New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
York. Her heart was so touched at the wretchedness
of the people that she resolved to do something
for them. Her friends tried to dissuade
her. Some said the people would kill her; some
said it was no use to try to help them. But she
went right forward, and now after years of labor
and sorrow there is her monument, saved children.</p>

<p>Before my return home in the country, aunt
Joanna gave a treat to the children of the Home
all at her own expense.</p>

<p>Maggie, once "Wild Maggie," and I served.
How many sandwiches I passed around, how
many cups of milk Maggie filled, how some of the
urchins were dressed, how they laughed, or chattered,
or stared, what they all said to aunt Joanna
about the "treat," would fill a book.</p>

<h2>MONKEY POCKETS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>I SUPPOSE you did not know that monkeys
had any pockets, save those in the little
green coats they sometimes wear. But that is
a mistake; their real pockets are in their cheeks.
The other evening, I travelled in the next compartment
to a little becoated monkey and his
master.</div>

<p>The little creature's day's work was over, and,
perched up on the sill of the carriage window,
he produced his supper from those stow-away
pockets of his, and commenced to munch it with
great enjoyment. Several times the platform
had to be cleared of the girls and boys who had
come to see the little friend off on his journey.
At length a porter, whose heart was warm toward
little folks, allowed them to slip in and remain.</p>

<p>The officials felt the attraction of that window;
and the stoker addressed the monkey as "mate."
Even the station-master as he passed cast a sly
glance toward the monkey, and a cheer was raised
when the train was set in motion, and the monkey
glided away from big and little spectators.</p>

<p>I heard the other day of a pet monkey called
Hag, a creature no larger than a guinea-pig,
whose master once found in his cheek pockets a
steel thimble, his own gold ring, a pair of sleeve-links,
a farthing, a button, a shilling, and a bit
of candy. Monkeys, I am sorry to say, are
given to stealing, and they use these pockets to
hide the articles which they have stolen.&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></p>

<h2>MY BRAINLESS ACQUAINTANCE.</h2>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">By Paranete.</span></div>


<h3>VII.&mdash;IN WHICH THE STORY IS FINISHED.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-a.jpg" width="55" height="112" alt="A" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"AN easy carriage came to the border of the
woods," my acquaintance continued,
"and the poor boy who had been shot
was put on a couch that had been fixed
in it, and carried home. All the other
boys went home too. They didn't feel like having
any more fun. The boy who had so carelessly
fired the last time could hardly be comforted,
and nobody blamed him, but every one
pitied him.</div>

<p>"I learned from day to day, from Fred and
the other members of the family, how the sick
boy was getting along. He was fast improving,
it seemed.</p>

<p>"I was soon transferred to the cushion from
which I had been taken, where I remained for
some time, until fall, indeed. From time to
time, though, I was used for little things by
different members of the family, but nothing
special occurred in my presence, and I was seldom
taken from my resting-place, for I was so
long, that it was seldom that any one wanted to
use me." (Moral: If you are <i>long</i> about doing
things, no one will want your help.)</p>

<p>"One day trunks were being packed, there
was a general air of 'going away' about the
house, and I learned that the lady, Fred's mother,
was going away to be gone for some time. The
children were to remain at home with their
father. The last day I, or, more properly speaking,
the pincushion on which I was, was packed
in a satchel, and taken to the depot, and I knew
no more of where I was for a good while, except
by the rocking and noise of the train. Soon the
satchel I was in was picked up, I felt the motion
of a carriage again, and when light was let in
upon me, we were in a room in a hotel, and my
mistress placed my pincushion on the bureau,
where I could see the busy street of a large city.
The pins that were with me were pretty good
company, and we remained in the city (that is,
my mistress did) for some weeks, when one day,
to our amazement, she packed up and went off,
leaving us behind!</p>

<div class="caption">THE COUNTRY BOARDING-HOUSE.</div>
</div>

<p>"Well, during that winter the room was occupied
by various persons, thus affording me opportunity
to study human nature, but I will not
tire you with the results of the study, for I am
simply telling you the story of my life. None
of these persons touched me, but finally all the
other pins were gone from the cushion, and I was
left alone, and consequently was rather lonesome.
The room was hired by a mother and
her baby, a father and his baby, a young couple
taking their wedding trip, I judged, and divers
and sundry other people, who, as I remarked before,
paid no attention to me. I grew more and
more lonely, and was almost despairing of ever
getting out of the hotel, when, one day, a fat old
gentleman was led into the room by the colored
porter, and established himself there. He was
an author"&mdash;</p>

<p>"The one that boards here now?" I interrupted.</p>

<p>"Never mind," responded the pin, "don't interrupt
me, please. This gentleman was an
author, as I said before. He had papers and
papers and papers! He had pens and pens
and pens! He had stylographic pens, Mackinnon
pens, and Paragon pens, and Todd's
pens, and other pens! He came there to be
quiet, he said, but he made more noise than anybody
else in the house, except the solo singer,
who roomed at our right, and the elocutionist
(female, of course) who roomed at our left.</p>

<p>"One day the old gentleman announced to
the porter that he couldn't stand it in that
horrid place any longer, and he must help him get
away the very next day. So he went. And as
he was packing up, he found one roll
of manuscript that wasn't pinned together,
and so he drew me out from
my long resting-place, much to my joy,
and fastened the roll together with me.</p>

<p>"I was packed up in his satchel,
and we journeyed quite a while. When
it was opened, we were in a pleasant
little room in a country boarding-house"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My mother's!" I again interrupted.</p>

<p>"Will you please be so kind as not
to interrupt me again?" said the pin,
his sharp voice growing sharper than
ever. "I found myself, as I remarked
before, in a pleasant little room in a
country boarding-house. The scenery
all around was very beautiful. There
were fields, a meadow, a brook and some
woods." (I very much wanted to interrupt
again, but I bit my tongue, and
squealed instead.)</p>

<p>"My master took long walks, and
would sit down every little while on
stone, stump, or fence, and write. One
day as he was going out he asked the lady of
the house to give him some lunch, as he would
probably not be back for a good while"&mdash;</p>

<p>"My mother!" I burst forth.</p>

<p>"I think you are very impolite," the pin replied.
"However, to pacify you, I will tell you
that you are correct&mdash;it was your mother, and
she put him up a nice lunch. He took quite a
little walk, meditating the while, and every
few moments he would lift up his arms, and discourse
enthusiastically on the beauty of Nature.
These talks were very uninteresting to
me, as I felt quite competent to decide for myself
what I thought of Nature, but I listened
silently and patiently. At one point in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
road the gentleman saw a good seat ahead, in
the form of a stump, and so he slung his satchel
on his arm, after getting some papers out, which
he commenced to pin together with me. But
at this point, as he was not engaged in looking
where he was going, his toe unfortunately collided
with the root of a stump which was firmly
fixed in the ground, and he fell flat! A breeze
coming up at the time, his papers, and so forth,
were scattered to the four winds as you might
say (though there was but one at the time), and
he probably will never find the most of them
again. His pens flew into a hollow stump near
by, I flew over to the roots of another stump,
and he fell on the satchel of lunch that your
mother had prepared for him, squeezing it all
out on the ground. Then he picked himself up
and went home.</p>

<p>"As for me, I remained where I fell until you
kindly brought me home with you this afternoon.</p>

<div class="caption">"I COULD SEE THE BUSY STREET OF A LARGE CITY."</div>
</div>

<p>"Now, my young friend, I will conclude. I
have done my work in this world, so far, as faithfully
as I knew how, and I think I have fulfilled
the purposes for which I was made. I hope I
have proved to you that pins are of some importance,
for I came very near causing the death
of one person and saved the life of another. If
you do your work, no matter how small it may
be, as well as I have, you will be as happy as I
am, perhaps not joyful, but you will at least be
satisfied with yourself, which is a great deal better
than being satisfied with others. I am
through."</p>

<p>The pin stopped.</p>

<p>"Now shall I take you back to the stump?"
I asked. But there was no answer given. I
repeated the question, but still I received no
reply.</p>

<p>Then I took my acquaintance up carefully, and
carried it back to the stump, laying it in a place
sheltered from the wet, as that worthy had requested.</p>

<p>"Here is your friend the pin," I said. But
the stump made no reply. So I turned sadly and
went home, and up to my room, to meditate on
the singular silence of both the pin and the
stump.</p>

<p>The supper bell startled me and I arose from
my chair and my reverie, and hastened down
stairs.</p>

<p>As I entered the dining-room, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
boarders said: "Why, where have you been all
the afternoon?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I took a walk down to Racket Brook,
and then I stayed up in my room the rest of the
time."</p>

<p>(<i>I</i> was not going to tell about the pin and his
story.)</p>

<p>"Are you sure you didn't come down again
after you went up just after dinner?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did," I indignantly replied.</p>

<p>"I peeped into your room this afternoon, and
you were asleep by your desk."</p>

<p>"You were, I know," assented my little
brother. "I saw you way down in the orchard,
and you were asleep with your head on the window
sill."</p>

<p>I made no reply, but went up to my room as
soon as I had finished my supper, and spent the
evening in writing my composition. And what
do you think it was? Why, just the story of
the pin as he told it to me that afternoon. The
children wanted to know if it was true, after I
had come down from the platform, having been
greatly applauded by the audience (the fat
author being in it). I replied that, every word
of it was true, and went with them to the shore
of the brook, where we found the identical stump
with the young beech-tree growing beside it.
Where was the pin? I do not know. It wasn't
there, though, much to my chagrin.</p>

<p>When I got home, the fat author wanted to
know if I would let him have my composition
for one chapter of his book. I was perfectly
willing, but when he showed me the chapter
afterward it was headed "A Boy's Dream."
And he had it that a boy had gone to sleep on
the window-sill, and had dreamed&mdash;my composition!</p>

<p>When I returned it to him he asked me what
I thought of it.</p>

<p>"I like it."</p>

<p>"And the title?"</p>

<p>I was silent for a moment&mdash;then I said,</p>

<p>"Perhaps it is so."</p>

<div class='blockquot'>


<p><span class="smcap">Note to all the Pansies.</span>&mdash;In my composition about the
pin, I mentioned several interesting things about the early history
of his family, etc., which he probably didn't know, or he
would have told me. If you would like to know about them,
just hunt up the word "pin" in the encyclopædia, and it will
tell you.</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>P.&mdash;PENN, WILLIAM.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE other day I was looking at a map
of Philadelphia, and at once my thoughts
went back to my schooldays and the
primary geography in which occurred
the question, "What can you say of
Philadelphia?" And the answer, "It is regularly
laid out, the streets crossing each other at
right angles like the lines on a checker-board."
And again, "What is Philadelphia sometimes
called?" Answer, "The City of Brotherly
Love."</div>

<p>And now I wish I could set before you the
calm, sweet, yet strong face of the man who
founded and named this city, who truly desired
it to be a city of love.</p>

<p>William Penn was a native of London. He
was born nearly a quarter of a century after the
Pilgrims landed upon Plymouth Rock; he belonged
to a good family, his father being Admiral
Sir William Penn of the British Navy.
It appears that the son was of a religious turn of
mind, and when he was a boy of twelve years he
believed himself to have been specially called to
a life of holiness. He was very carefully educated,
but he offended his father by joining the
Quakers; indeed, it seems that several times in
the course of his life his father became very much
displeased with him, but a reconciliation always
followed, and at last the Admiral left all his
estate to the son who had been such a trial to
him. While a student at the University, Penn
and his Quaker friends rebelled against the
authority of the college and was expelled. The
occasion of the rebellion was in the matter of
wearing surplices and of uncovering the head in
the presence of superiors. You know that the
Quakers always keep their hats on, thinking it
wrong to show to man the honor which they
consider belongs only to God. And this reminds
me to tell you that in the <i>Wide Awake</i> for February,
I think, Mr. Brooks has told a pretty story
of William Penn and St. Valentine's Day, in
which he mentions this refusal to uncover in the
presence of the king even, as one cause of trouble
between the father and son.</p>

<p>I cannot follow with you all the vicissitudes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Penn's life; after leaving the University he
travelled upon the Continent. Afterwards he
studied law in London; he became a soldier.
This strikes us as being somewhat curious when
we remember that the sect to which he belonged
are opposed to war, and preach the doctrine of
love and peace. However, he was not long in
service, and meeting a noted Quaker preacher
he became firmly fixed in his devotion to the
society of Friends, and was ever after a strong
advocate of its doctrines; nothing could turn
him from the path he had chosen. He was several
times imprisoned on account of his religious
opinions and suffered persecution and abuse.
Through all he adhered to his views, and stood
by his Quaker friends in the dark days of persecution.
He had inherited from his father a
claim against the British Government of several
thousand pounds, and in settlement of this claim
he received a large tract of land in the then New
World. With the title to the land he secured
the privilege of founding a colony upon principles
in accordance with his religious views.
And in 1682 he came to America and laid the
foundations not only of the City of Brotherly
Love, but of the State of Pennsylvania. His object
was to provide a place of refuge for the oppressed
of his own sect, but all denominations
were welcomed, and many Swedes as well as
English people came. While other colonies
suffered from the attacks of the Indians, for
more than seventy years, so long as the colony
was under the control of the Quakers, no Indian
ever raised his hatchet against a Pennsylvania
settler. Under a great elm-tree, long known as
Penn's elm, he met the Indians in council, soon
after his arrival in the territory which had been
ceded to him. He said to them:</p>

<p>"My friends, we have met on the broad pathway
of good faith. We are all one flesh and
blood. Being brethren, no advantage shall be
taken on either side. Between us there shall be
nothing but openness and love."</p>

<p>And they replied, "While the rivers run
and the sun shines, we will live in peace with
the children of William Penn."</p>

<p>It has been said that this is the only treaty
never sworn to and never broken.</p>

<p>William Penn lived to see his enterprise
achieve a grand success. Philadelphia had
grown to be a city of no small dimensions and
no little importance. The colony had grown to
be a strong, self-supporting State, capable of
self-government.</p>

<p>"I will found a free colony for all mankind,"
said William Penn. Were these the words of
a great man?</p>

<p>Unswerving integrity, undaunted courage, adherence
to duty, and devotion to the service of
God&mdash;are these the characteristics of a great
man? Then William Penn may well be placed
in our Alphabet of Great Men.</p>

<h2>ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON.</h2>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">By Margaret Sidney.</span></div>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-m2.jpg" width="67" height="114" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">MEANWHILE what of St. George and
his faithful comrade? Speeding on in
the railroad train, after the departure
of the luckless Thomas, they had ample
time to bemoan the annoyance of the
boys left to the cold comfort of a night on
Sachem Hill, and the distress of all the parents
when the condition of things became known.</div>

<p>"I'm awfully glad we knew enough to cut and
run," exclaimed Phipps Benton, hugging himself
in his cosey car-corner, "at least that <i>you</i> knew
enough," he corrected himself honestly; "that
last skate cost those chaps something. Won't
Pa Bangs give it to Wilfred though!"</p>

<p>He couldn't help the shrug of delight as this
thought seized him. Wilfred, to state it mildly,
was not a boy to be loved dearly, and circumstances
now seemed likely to make him anything
but an object of envy.</p>

<p>"For shame!" cried St. George hotly, "we've
just been there, and he's treated us well."</p>

<p>Phipps flushed all over his brown little face,
and looked out of the window into the gathering
night. St. George jumped out of his seat, and
walked rapidly and unsteadily down the aisle to
shake off some of his excitement. That he was
going home to his mother all right, warm and
safe to a capital supper such as only she knew
how to get up for a hungry boy, tired and cold
after a long winter-day frolic, made it all the
worse that other boys who had so little while
ago been the larger part of his laughing, noisy
troop, should be at this very minute, shivering,
half-starved and cross, at their wits' end how to
pass the night. He could almost see Bridget
setting on the supper things, smell the delicious
coffee permeating the house, and hear his mother
say, "Come, it is almost time for my boy to be
here, you better begin to mix your cake-batter,"
and his mouth almost watered as he thought of
the toothsome, smoking hot cakes that would
before long be piled upon his plate.</p>

<p>But suddenly he stopped. No cakes for him
that night&mdash;perhaps not even coffee. Who
would tell those parents of the fifteen or so boys
stranded on Sachem Hill why they were not to
come bounding into their several homes on the
arrival of the six o'clock train in the B. and A.
Depot? George Edward and Phipps must do
all those errands before they could hope to enjoy
any supper that night.</p>

<p><i>Whew!</i> He drew himself up with a long
breath, turned and rushed back to his seat.</p>

<p>"See here," he cried, throwing himself down,
"you can take all the places nearest to your house&mdash;and
I'll do the same."</p>

<p>Phipps turned and regarded him with a stare.</p>

<p>"To tell the fathers and mothers," explained
St. George with a nod, "no other way, you see,
why the chaps don't get home."</p>

<p>"Good gracious!" cried Phipps explosively,
"I never thought of that. We can't! We're
as hungry as beavers."</p>

<p>"We must." St. George laughed gayly, now
that the struggle was over, and indulged in a
smart pinch on his companion's shoulder.
"Wake up, old fellow."</p>

<p>"You let me be," cried Phipps crossly, shaking
him off, "and you get out with your 'musts.'
I don't know any, I can tell you, and as for going
around to tell a lot of people what's none of
my business, you won't see me doing it. I'm
going home myself."</p>

<p>"Who will do it then?" demanded St. George
just as sharply.</p>

<p>"Don't know," said Phipps doggedly, "only I
know I won't, that's all." He returned the look
his companion gave him with another no pleasanter,
and every whit as determined.</p>

<p>"And you mean to let those fathers and
mothers go all night without knowing where in
creation the chaps are?" cried the other boy in
the seat, every feature ablaze with indignation.
"Say?"</p>

<p>"They should have come along; it's their own
fault they got left."</p>

<p>"But the fathers and mothers aren't to blame,"
insisted St. George vehemently. "Yours would
go most crazy if you didn't turn up at the right
time."</p>

<p>Phipps, however, was not to allow his feelings
to be worked upon in this way. He now found
himself very cold, decidedly hungry, and violently
cross, and, giving St. George a push, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
declared, "I tell you I won't do a single thing,
nor take a single step. I can't hardly move, and
I shall go straight home."</p>

<p>"Of course," said St. George, brightening up,
and relaxing a bit, "so shall I, to tell my
folks."</p>

<p>"I shall <i>stay</i> there," said Phipps obstinately.
With that he turned again to the window.</p>

<p>"Do!" burst out St. George in high scorn,
"and save your stingy, mean, little pinched-up
carcass!"</p>

<p>"Boys," said an old gentleman back of them,
leaning forward to bring his stern face over into
the excitement, "I should think if you must
fight, you could find some other place a little
more appropriate than a crowded rail-car."</p>

<p>St. George brought his flushed face over
against that of the old gentleman, and sprang to
his feet, reaching for the skates dangling from
the rack overhead, while he shivered all over
with anger and mortification. Phipps did not
turn his head.</p>

<p>The old gentleman seeing that his shaft had
struck home, wounding at least one individual,
put himself back in his own seat, well pleased,
and St. George summarily retreated to the rear
of the car, full of reflections the farthest removed
from agreeable ones.</p>

<p>Here he was in a quarrel, and just a moment
before he had been giving advice how to spare
the feelings of others, and he couldn't control
his own, but must anger Phipps with whom he
had never had the least falling out. <i>Faugh!</i>
He was so disgusted with himself, he would
have thanked any one who would take him one
side, and give him that castigation he felt he so
richly deserved. And there were the eyes of all
the passengers in the car directed to him, as if
he were a person whose movements were singular,
to say the least, and would bear watching. Half
of them had heard the old gentleman's sharp, ringing
rebuke even if they had not been listeners to
the quarrel itself, and the other half were now,
he felt, staring at him and whispering over him
as he stood pretending to look out of the door,
while their eyes seemed burning holes into his
jacket.</p>

<p>It was interminable, that hour before they
could reach the B. and A. Depot, and the
only relief he experienced was in pulling out his
watch every five moments to see what time it
was.</p>

<p>At last, in the train swept to the depot. St.
George looked back quickly, intending to rush
back, bestow a thwack on Phipps' back, say he
was sorry, and make up. But the throng was
great and a woman with a baby asked him to
help her off the car, so by the time he got free
most of the passengers had filed out and were
hurrying along the platform. St. George caught
a flying glimpse of the boy he sought, some
little distance ahead, and he bounded after him.</p>

<p>"Phipps," he cried, darting in and out between
the people, and dodging an expressman with a
barrow, "wait, old chap."</p>

<p>St. George was positive that his call was
heard, but the boy in front now gathered up
his skates to a tighter clasp and broke into a
run.</p>

<p>St. George chased him so long as he saw the
least chance of gaining on him, then suddenly
pulled up.</p>

<p>"All right," he gasped, "if you want it that
way, you may have it. I don't care."</p>

<h2>A WAIF FROM THE SKIES.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>IN throwing out ballast or any small article
from a balloon, a certain degree of caution
is requisite, as a bottle or any similar object falls
with such velocity that were it to strike the roof
of a cottage, it would go right through it. We
are told that Gray-Lussac, in an ascent in 1804,
threw out a common deal chair from a height
of twenty-three thousand feet. It fell beside a
country girl, who was tending some sheep in a
field, and, as the balloon was invisible, she concluded,
and so did wiser heads than hers, that
the chair must have fallen straight down from
heaven.</div>

<p>No one was skeptical enough to deny it, for
there was the chair, or rather its remains. The
most the incredulous could venture to do was to
criticise the coarse workmanship of the miraculous
seat, and they were busy carping and fault-finding
with the celestial upholstery, when an account
of M. Gray-Lussac's voyage was published,
and extinguished at once the discussion and the
miracle.&mdash;<i>Chambers' Journal.</i></p>

<p>"I never
would
have
made a
camel,
that's
certain,"
remarked a wise (?) lad, after taking a
slight look at the ungainly beast.</p>

<p>"Probably not," answered his wiser father.
"You would have put the same material into
pop-guns or ponies."</p>

<p>"But see what an ugly thing he is; not a
handsome feature about him," still urged the
boy.</p>

<p>"Handsome is that handsome does," came
back to him.</p>

<p>"Look at those abominable humps on his
back. Why must he be disfigured in that
way?"</p>

<p>"Does a trunk disfigure a traveller?" quietly
asked the father.</p>

<p>"But what has that ill-looking hump to do
with a trunk, I'd like to know?" continued
his questioner.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 463px;">
<img src="images/illus061.jpg" width="463" height="248" alt="camel with saddle on" />
<div class="caption">GENERAL GORDON'S CAMEL.</div>
</div>

<p>"There are many more things you ought to
'like to know.' That ill-looking hump is his
trunk, which his master sees is well packed with&mdash;fat&mdash;before
he starts on the long journey
over the deserts where he can't be sure of any
grass or shrubs for days and days. But there is
that trunk full on his back from which the camel
picnics on the weary way."</p>

<p>"Oh! you don't say he carries water there
too!"</p>

<p>"No; but near by, in another trunk or bottle.
He has an extra supply in his stomach. Those
'clumsy' feet are <i>beautifully</i> formed for travelling
the desert. Scientific folks might have
studied for ages without discovering and patenting
such a marvel of a desert foot.</p>

<p>"You see no beauty in his eyelashes and queer
nose, but you would, after a day in the burning
sun or flying sand of the desert. Why, my boy,
there's no beast like him for use in his own
land.</p>

<p>"Just see him, knelt there for his load of one
thousand or fifteen hundred pounds, and objecting
as plainly as a camel can, when a little too
much is put upon him. Then rising up and
moving on his way in such dignified patience, on
and on, hour after hour, seventy-five or one hundred
miles a day. Know of a horse that could
do that, my boy?</p>

<p>"He is justly called the 'Ship of the Desert.'"</p>

<p>"'Ugly beast,' indeed!" repeated his father.
"Think you Gordon called him so?"</p>

<p>"Gordon? Who did you say?"</p>

<p>"General Gordon. That brave, grand man
who went to Khartoom to save the garrison and
people there from falling into the hands of the
false prophet?</p>

<p>"It almost seems as if the noble camel that
carried him hundreds of miles on the way, knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
what General Gordon was going for; he just
hurried right on without a word of complaint,
till he could not move a step further; then another
gladly took his place and pushed on day
and night till Charles James Gordon passed
through the gates and the city shouted for joy.</p>

<p>"Now can't you see some beauty in this
beast?"</p>

<h2>SOME REMARKABLE WOMEN.</h2>

<h3>M.&mdash;MITFORD, MARY RUSSEL.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="57" height="112" alt="O" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">"OUR village!" Do you suppose you
could write a book about your village?
Could you find enough matters of interest
to make one book? And yet
Miss Mitford wrote five with that title.
She wrote about the houses and the people, the
shops, the children, about life in an English
country village, and delightful reading her
sketches are. She wrote as no one had ever before
written, and perhaps I might say that no
one since has ever written such charming bits of
description of rural life.</div>

<div class="figright" style="width: 295px;">
<img src="images/illus065.jpg" width="295" height="422" alt="lady" />
<div class="caption">MISS MITFORD.</div>
</div>
<p>She wrote other books, <i>Atherton, and Other
Tales</i>, <i>Country Stories</i>, and then she wrote such
delightful letters to her friends. You will find
some of these in her <i>Life and Correspondence</i>.
She was the daughter of wealthy parents, who
later in life became poor. So that from a life
of luxury our gifted author was reduced to
poverty.</p>

<p>The latter part of her life must have contrasted
painfully with the days of her childhood,
yet she kept through all her trials her
sweet serenity of mind, her habit of making the
best of everything. She is described as a short,
stout woman, with a face shining with quiet
happiness and unselfishness. The appreciation
with which her sketches were received gave her
much pleasure, and the fact that her writings
were re-printed in America afforded her the
greatest gratification, while it was a surprise to
her.</p>

<p>She was a delightful person to meet socially,
having charming ways and a soft, sweet voice.
She died in a wee bit of a house, in 1855, at the
age of sixty-eight.</p>

<p>Do you ask why I have chosen to place Miss
Mitford in our list of Remarkable Women?
To begin with, she was the first to discover and
set before us in prose writing the beauty in
every-day things. She had written poems and
tried her hand at writing tragedy, but with indifferent
success, and at length when poverty
stared her in the face she took up the then new
line of writing and tried with grand success to
show to the world the beauty there is in common
things. Then all through her long life with
its sad changes she kept that wonderful serenity
of mind, and that happy faculty of living above
the vexations of life. Many a woman when
forced by growing poverty to move from place
to place, each time going to a poorer home,
would have grown faint and weary of life, and
given up in despair.</p>

<p>If we cultivate the habit of making the best
of everything, we shall be the better prepared
to meet the vicissitudes of life.</p>

</div>

<div class='drop-cap'>I SHOULD suggest, dear Pansies, for this
lovely month of May, a little evening festival.
Winter is over with its long, delightfully
cosey evenings. Spring is nearly done, with its
shorter evenings, and now we are fairly launched
into the flower months&mdash;when all life seems an
holiday, and every moment that is possible is to
be passed out of doors.</div>

<p>To get ready for my little proposed festival,
everybody must go a-Maying. With baskets, and
fern cases, let the children, papa and mamma,
nursey, aunt Grace, uncle Fred, and indeed every
one who will drop books and work, and go off to
the woods for the wild treasures that are playing
hide-and-seek there. We do not want on this
lovely May festival, any flowers but wild ones
that have grown silently all winter under the
snow, waiting for us. Their reign is short indeed.
We will give them one evening all to
themselves before we turn to June with her
wealth of roses, and all other sweet and glowing
blossoms.</p>

<p>Let us gather them all&mdash;the hepaticas, the
anemones, darling little forget-me-nots, violets,
Solomon's seal, and&mdash;but the name is legion&mdash;and
the varieties multiply as we dig and
prowl in the damp moss, and explore behind
rocks and in crannies. Put them all in the
baskets and cases, surrounded by their own
moss to keep them green, not forgetting to bring
as many roots as possible, cover all with lovely
vines, and come home, flowers in the baskets,
and flowers in your cheeks.</p>

<p>Amy and Ruth have been very busy. No
one exactly knew why they got up so early
in the morning. No one but the cook, and she
promised not to tell. But in the cake-box is a
toothsome collection of sugar wafers, ready to
be put on the flower-crowned table, and the two
little girls have every little while that pleasant
"woodsy morning," as Ruth called it, flown at
each other in the secret places, when resting
from their flower-digging, and something like
this might have been heard, if there had been
ears to hear. But there were none, only those
of the squirrels, and they looked wise, and determined
not to tell. "Oh, I <i>hope</i> they will be
good."</p>

<p>"Our new receipt. Just think, if they
shouldn't like them!"</p>

<p>Bob has a secret too. Why can't boys as well
as girls have one, pray tell. That is, no one but
papa knows it, but then papa has a fashion without
ever asking, of being informed of his boy's
movements.</p>

<p>Bob's twenty-five cents hoarded for two weeks,
went into the grocer's till only yesterday, and
Bob has twelve bright yellow lemons instead,
waiting as patiently as lemons will, to be sacrificed
to a thirsty group who stand around the
same flower-crowned table. Bob's papa is to
give the sugar, and moreover he has promised
to tie on another apron and help the boy make
the loveliest lemonade on that very same night.
So Bob and his papa must of necessity go off together
on this "woodsy morning" to hunt for
flowers, for there is danger if they staid with
the large group that they would let the whole
thing out. Oh, what fun, to have papa to one's
self and a secret!</p>

<p>Now then, after your invitations to two or
three neighbors, and a little friend or two who
hasn't many pleasures of her own, are given out
for this evening, and your wood-treasures are
ready, and you have had a good lunch and are
all bathed and rested, you have nothing to do
but to arrange your table with banks of moss,
flowers and vines, get uncle Fred who is to give
the little talk on "Plants and their Habits," to
settle his microscope and specimens just where
he wants them in the evening, Mary puts out the
music on the piano-rack that she has promised
to play, the two secrets are out, because there
are the trays laden with sugar wafers, and two
bright-faced, white-capped young girls, one with
blue ribbons and the other with pink, to pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
them around, and there's the lemonade table in
the corner, with a big pail covered with green
moss, a little well sweep to which is fastened the
Baby's tiny pail for a bucket, and Bob stands
back of it all with a beaming face ready to serve
you to glassesfull from the "old oaken bucket."</p>

<p>Oh, it is rare fun, this dainty May festival&mdash;the
best part after all being the "Plant talk,"
and the wonders to which the company, young
and old, are brought to see through the microscope.
Each small spear of green has its delicate
meaning&mdash;each blossom its tender message.
Nothing has been lost there so long under the
snow, and the good Giver tells anew to these
awakened minds, his story of creative love.
Dear children, I hope you will have in each
family a "May festival," and my most loving
wish is that it may be a happy, bright, and joyous
one.</p>

YOU want a story, another story,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">One you have never heard before?</span><br />
Stories don't come when you call them, always;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I do not know any more.</span><br />
"Jack and the Bean-Stalk," "Goldilocks,"<br />
"Bright Prince Charming," "Reynard the Fox,"<br />
And now you ask for a "spandy-new" one,<br />
About your Jack-In-The-Box!<br />
<br />
Poor little Jack-In-The-Box, who never<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Can open his door himself;</span><br />
Whose house is so small that it almost pinches,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With neither cupboard nor shelf.</span><br />
Dark, beside, with a varnishy smell,<br />
Enough to keep him from feeling well,<br />
And a crick in his back that must surely hurt him,<br />
If he could only tell!<br />
<br />
Now, let's pretend; when he first was finished,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This rosy-cheeked little Jack,</span><br />
He stood up straight, with his hands beside him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And never a crick in his back.</span><br />
Oh, what a beautiful world of toys!<br />
Little doll-girls and little doll-boys;<br />
Drums and trumpets, and everything lovely<br />
For making a splendid noise!<br />
<br />
Ah, but wait&mdash;he is not quite finished;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Poor little rosy Jack!</span><br />
A knife, some glue, some muslin, some paper&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>Now</i> there's a crick in his back!</span><br />
Oh, but the hot glue made him smart;<br />
How near the sharp knife went to his heart;<br />
And for five dreadful, dreadful minutes,<br />
His head and feet were apart!<br />
<br />
Now for the box&mdash;it is very pretty,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Painted a charming red.</span><br />
In he goes, his feet are fastened;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Down comes the lid on his head!</span><br />
Oh, he knew he was going to smother!<br />
He'd have called mamma if he'd owned a mother,<br />
But he'd nobody nearer than distant cousins,<br />
Neither sister nor brother.<br />
<br />
Frantic his struggles for fifteen minutes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But it seemed, the more he tried,</span><br />
The tighter his house grew; then his courage<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Failed; and he cried and cried.</span><br />
Then he heard laughter, soft and low;<br />
His door flew up, and he heard an "Oh!"<br />
And a dear little face was bent above him&mdash;<br />
Your little face, you know.<br />
<br />
Over and over the darkness caught him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lid came down on him tight;</span><br />
But he soon found out that after the darkness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Always would come the light.</span><br />
He was a hero! Up he went<br />
Whenever the lid rose; not content<br />
With merely rising, he came up smiling,<br />
Though all of his strength was spent.<br />
<br />
That was the story. Grave and silent<br />

Looking down with a tender pity,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At brave Jack-In-The-Box.</span><br />
"Thank you, auntie," was all she said.<br />
But I found that night, when she'd gone to bed,<br />
Jack's box in the grate, and Jack on her pillow,<br />
Close to the golden head.<br />

<h2>PATTY PLUMMER'S TRIAL.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-p.jpg" width="53" height="114" alt="P" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">PATTY PLUMMER awoke one lovely
August morning with a delightful feeling
that something nice was going to
happen that day. The sun was shining
in on the rough board walls of her little
chamber, and she could see the bits of broken
china and glass glitter in her playhouse&mdash;a
corner of the room outside. Then she thought
of her dream! Patty laughed aloud as she
dressed herself, at the thought of her old broken
dolly Lulu Jane chasing her round the house,
and squeezing through a tiny crack when she
tried to shut her in the sitting-room!</div>

<p>"Aha! I just know why I dreamed that! I
know what makes me so happy!" and she danced
round in her stocking feet, singing her gayest
song, quite forgetful of the old saying,</p>

<div class='poem'>
Sing before eating<br />
And you'll cry before sleeping!<br />
</div>

<p>"Oh! I do hope she'll bring it to-day," Patty
cried as she put on her slippers and ran out to
her play-house, where in a parlor gorgeous with
yellow paper carpet and green pasteboard chairs,
stood an old accordion as a doll's piano, with a
gayly-dressed rag lady sitting before it on a velvet-covered
spool, and a fine gentleman by her
side in blue paper trousers and black silk jacket.</p>

<p>Now the "she" of Patty's remarks was her
clever cousin Charlotte who had taken home the
"it"&mdash;no other than broken-headed, torn-to-pieces
old Lulu Jane herself&mdash;to make therefrom,
as she declared to Patty the day before,
"the finest rag doll she ever saw!"</p>

<p>"I do b'leeve she'll bring it home this very
afternoon," happy Patty kept saying to herself,
as she flew out of doors after breakfast and
worship was over. Everything seemed lovelier
than ever this one fair morning. The little
rock-basin filled by water trickling down from a
higher one, which Charlotte had named "the
fountain," seemed the most wonderful thing
that ever was; the hollyhocks and lady-delights
fairly smiled as she bent over the flower mound
to admire them&mdash;all was cheerful and gay.</p>

<p>How Patty loved to go over by herself the
events of a pleasant play-day with Charlotte!
There was the little stone oven place with a
mock fire of sticks, where they had played at
boiling a pudding made of mud and tied in a
rag, while the pot was a hollow ribbon block
from old Miss Simpkins' store! there hung the
swing her father had made between two ash-trees
for her and her cousin. She climbed on the notched
board and swayed to and fro, every now and then
looking up the pasture hill to see if Charlotte
was coming down the path from uncle Nathan's.</p>

<p>By and by she gave a joyful shout. An old-fashioned,
two-seated carriage was coming up
the long grassy lane from the big gate opening
into the street. Mother Plummer ran to the
door with flowery hands to see Patty's Grandmother
Pratt getting out of the carriage. Such
goodies as grandma always brought from Mill
Village when she came to see the Plummers!
This time the driver, uncle Dave, lifted out a
huge basket of big fresh blackberries and a large
newly caught salmon. Patty was not forgotten;
grandma never came without something for her
little namesake. The last time she brought Patty
a pretty plaid gingham; this time the gift was
a gay Indian basket full of tiny pats of yellow
butter, covered with cool, broad rhubarb leaves.</p>

<p>"O, this is the goodest day that ever I did
see!" warbled Patty to the tune of The Battle
Hymn of the Republic, as she followed the dear
plump old lady into the house. The summer
day was as perfect as a day could be. Inside
the house everything was sunshiny and cheerful
too; and Patty opened her glad heart to take in
the pleasure of all things to the uttermost.
Grandmother sat in the arm-chair swaying the
huge palm-leaf fan as she loosened the ribbon
cap strings at her fat white throat, and Patty sat
on a cricket beside her in perfect content. They
were going to have such a lovely dinner! Tempting
pink salmon, mealy new potatoes, blackberries
with cream and sugar, and a dainty pie
which Patty's eyes spied through the half-open
pantry door. A dainty turnover beside it too, on
purpose for Patty! Never thought of clouds or
showers came into her heart as she sat there
softly stroking grandma's gown of silver gray.</p>

<p>"Tinkle, inkle," came the sound of old Daisy's
bell from the pasture; and the sound started a
new train of glad thoughts. If Charlotte would
only come with Lulu Jane, what fun she would
have showing the doll to grandma! Grandma
always took an interest in her doll babies&mdash;even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
in Augustus with his blue paper trousers!</p>

<p>They were all seated around the dining-table,
Patty beside grandma, with the turnover in her
hand to keep it from uncle Dave who pretended
he was going to eat it, when the back door opened.
Patty's heart went pit-a-pat, and she ran out
with mother's leave, turnover and all, to meet
cousin Charlotte in the dim little entry.</p>

<p>"Here it is," said Charlotte. "I hope you'll
be pleased with it; and I must go right back,
'cause I've got to do a big stent o' patchwork 'n
help aunt Betsy get supper for comp'ny." Patty
took the bundle to the out-door light, and when
she opened it, danced and screamed with delight.</p>

<p>"You dear, darling old thing!" she cried,
hugging Charlotte so hard she fairly hurt her.
"How did you fix her up so nice?" she sat on the
doorstep admiring Lulu Jane between bites of
turnover while Charlotte flew home like a bird.</p>

<p>The doll had a new smooth white linen face,
the head nicely joined at the top instead of being
sewn with big black stitches as Patty sewed hers.
The face had beet-juice cheeks and black bead
eyes, the feet were neatly shod with velvet, and
the old gown had been replaced by a pink ruffled
one of calico, edged at the neck with a frill
of lace. But the crowning glory was a little
pink bonnet trimmed with a downy chicken's
feather and a tiny spray of snakeberry vine from
which hung wee scarlet berries! Patty hugged
her treasure closely, and ran to the swing to enjoy
it by herself. Uncle Dave was coming, and
he might run off with it just to tease her. By
and by she ran in to show it to grandma.</p>

<p>"Deary, deary!" said grandma, as she took
the dolly from Patty and examined it through
her spectacles. "Nice piece o' work, quite a
neat little gownd, 'n a bunnit too! Charlotte
must be quite tasty."</p>

<p>Grandma held it in her fat hand a minute and
then after fumbling in her big pocket she brought
out a shining new quarter-dollar.</p>

<p>"Patty," said she, looking down into the wondering
eyes of her little granddaughter, "I'd like
to buy this pretty doll to take home to your little
cousin Bessie Alice. She's coming to spend
to-morrow with me and she'll think so much of a
doll that came 'way from Mapleton." The cloud
had come down over the sun; the gladness of the
perfect day was completely darkened by the trial
which suddenly loomed up before the child.</p>

<p>"Why, gra'ma!" cried she, the tears flowing
fast, "you don't want me to let you have my
darling sweety Lulu Jane, when she just got all
fixed up new! I never could let her go! Please
give her to me, grandma." Grandma placed the
precious doll in Patty's arms and said quietly:</p>

<p>"I won't take your doll away if you aren't
willing; but I was thinkin' how pleased Bessie
Alice would be; you know she's no ma now 'n
no Charlotte to make dolls for her like you have.
Then you'd have the quarter to help buy you a
winter hat, and Charlotte would make you another
dolly, I'm sure. But if you aren't willing
I'll say no more about it," and she put the bright
quarter away in her big pocket again.</p>

<p>"Can I have a little while to think it over?"
asked Patty timidly. Her good mother had
taught her to think matters over before she decided,
and the sight of the money had brought
something to her mind. The Sunday-school
superintendent had told the children only last
Sunday about two good women who had left
their homes to teach the poor Labrador children
about Jesus. They needed books and papers.
Miss Bridgman, Patty's teacher, had asked her
class if they could not bring some money next
Sunday even if they had to deny themselves of
something to get it. Patty thought it all over upstairs.
She looked at the beautiful bonnet, the
velvet shoes and the pink ruffles, and gave the
doll a hard hug as she cried amid falling tears:</p>

<p>"I can't give her to gra'ma, I can't sell her!
I wish gra'ma 'd never come! I wish Bessie
Alice 'd never been born! That hateful thing!
She's got red hair, 'n she did just pinch me
awful, once! Oh, dear, <i>dear</i>, <small>DEAR</small>! this is the
nastiest day I ever did see!" and she threw herself
on the trundle bed in a spasm of grief.</p>

<p>Then better thoughts came.</p>

<p>"Why, ain't I a goose! What am I cryin'
for? I needn't sell her 'f I don't wan't to!
Poor Bessie Alice, I'm awful sorry she's got no
mother to tuck her in bed 'n' kiss her! I s'pose
Jesus 'd be pleased if I let her have it. I'd
rather have Lulu Jane than twenty quarters;
but I'd have all that money to take to Miss
Bridgman Sunday, 'n that would please Jesus
too. And I do want to please Him, I'm sure!
Of course Charlotte would make me another!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
She's such a '<i>genius</i> girl, mother says. I'll go
right away 'n give dolly to gra'ma. I'm goin' to
sell it to you," handing the fine lady to Grandmother
Pratt. "I want the money for the missionaries,
'n I do pity Bessie Alice. Put her
away quick, so I won't want her again," said
Patty, dancing away with the quarter in her hand.</p>

<p>"You are a darlin' child, cert'in," said
grandma, looking fondly after her.</p>

<p>"Well, this has been the queerest day!" said
little Patty as she sat on the doorstep that night
watching the old carriage roll away toward Mill
Village. "I'd like to have Lulu Jane to play
with, 'n' I don't know what Charlotte'll say; but
I b'leeve I feel happier now than I did this
mornin', 'n I was happy then 's I could be!"</p>

<h2>HARRY'S SACRIFICE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-s.jpg" width="53" height="112" alt="S" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi4">"SELL Jack! No, indeed, not for any
money!"</div>

<p>Harry Danvers responded to Colonel
Bates' offer almost indignantly.</p>

<p>"It is a good offer for the dog," continued
the colonel, "more than he is really worth,
but Frank has taken a fancy to him, and to
gratify him I am willing to give a good price."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 408px;">
<img src="images/illus076.jpg" width="408" height="496" alt="dog" />
<div class="caption">JACK.</div>
</div>

<p>"No, sir; I shall want
money worse than I ever
have yet when I part with
Jack. Thank you for the
offer, but I cannot sell my
dog."</p>

<p>"That is a foolish boy,"
said the colonel, turning
to a friend as Harry
went off down the street
whistling to his dog; "I
made him a good offer.
You know my boy Frank
is an invalid, and it was to
gratify a whim of his that
I offered the boy twice the
worth of the dog."</p>

<p>"I heard your offer,
and I confess I thought
it very liberal," replied the
friend; "has the boy rich
parents, that he can afford
to reject such offers?"</p>

<p>"No; Danvers is only a
day laborer, and I do not
suppose the boy ever had
five dollars pocket money
in his life."</p>

<p>"Humph!" was the expressive
rejoinder of the
friend; then the subject
was dropped.</p>

<p>There was a missionary
convention in progress in the town where
Harry Danvers lived. Harry was not specially
interested in missions, though he was a Sunday-school
scholar and a member of a Mission Band;
but someway he did not get interested in the
Band. And I suspect that boys generally fail
to become interested in the Mission Bands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Can you tell why it is that our missionary
societies are so largely made up of girls?</p>

<p>Harry had no thought of going to any of the
meetings in progress, but at tea time his sister
Alice said:</p>

<p>"Harry, they say that the teacher from the
school where our Band supports a pupil is going
to speak to-night at the First Church; let's go
down."</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear any missionary women
speak," said Harry.</p>

<p>"But, my son, if your sister wants to go, you
will not refuse to go with her?" said Mr.
Danvers.</p>

<p>"I suppose I can go," replied Harry, not ungraciously,
but somewhat indifferently.</p>

<p>"I do want to go; and, Harry, you know you
said you were to write an essay on the Indian
question for next Wednesday; maybe you'll get
some ideas; you know Miss R&mdash;&mdash; is from the
Indian Territory."</p>

<p>"All right! Count me in. I'll be ready in
a jiffy."</p>

<p>Harry Danvers was never the same boy after
that evening. You might not have noticed the
difference, but it was there. He could never
again be indifferent towards Missions. He
gained, as Alice had suggested, some ideas, but
not altogether in the line of his school essay.
He for the first time in his life realized that he,
Harry Danvers, had a part in the great work
given to the church of Christ; that the responsibility
of sending the Gospel to the heathen nations
rested upon him in proportion to his ability,
and the question, What can <i>I</i> give? was pressed
home upon his heart. The duty and privilege of
sacrifice were set before him, and he asked himself,
What can I sacrifice? The questions were
unanswered when he went to bed that night.
Harry was a Christian boy, and he carried his
questioning to his Heavenly Father, and waited
for the answer. The next morning as he went
down stairs, with Jack's customary greeting
there came to him the answer he had sought.
Here was an opportunity to prove his sincerity!
Was he equal to the sacrifice?</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Harry?" asked his
mother; "are you sick?"</p>

<p>"The missionary meeting was too much for
him, I guess," said Alice.</p>

<p>"Didn't you like the speaker?" asked Mr.
Danvers.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; <i>I</i> liked it all very much. Mother,
you ought to go this morning; they say there
is a perfectly wonderful speaker to be on the
platform&mdash;a woman from Syria; are <i>you</i> going,
Harry?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Harry indifferently.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Alice; "boys are so queer.
Now I thought it was just splendid last evening,
but Harry won't even say he liked it. I was all
stirred up and ready to give all my jewelry&mdash;only
I haven't any to give," and Alice chattered
on until breakfast was over, and the family went
their several ways. All the time Harry was
thinking, and, as you will see, thinking to some
purpose. He had an errand down town for his
mother, and as he went out of the gate he said
with energy, "I'll do it!"</p>

<p>Now Mrs. Danvers was a timid woman, and
very much afraid of dogs. True, she tried to
hide her fear and aversion for Harry's sake, but
she had a nervous dread of some member of the
family being bitten by the dog, and only a few
days before, Harry's father said: "My boy, I
sometimes wish you could make up your mind
to give that dog away; your mother dislikes
dogs so much."</p>

<p>Remembering this, Harry did not consider it
necessary to say anything to his father about
what he intended to do. His way down the street
led him past Colonel Bates' residence. He
stopped at the door and rang the bell, asking to
see Colonel Bates. When that gentleman appeared
he said, though his voice trembled,</p>

<p>"Have you bought a dog for Frank yet?"</p>

<p>"No; have you made up your mind to part
with yours?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; if your offer holds good for to-day."</p>

<p>"Certainly; walk in and we will settle the
business. I am very glad; we are going to a
rather lonely place for the summer, and the dog
will be both a comfort and protection to Frank."</p>

<p>The transfer of property was made in the
course of the morning, and, strangely enough,
Colonel Bates sat beside Harry that evening in
the meeting and caught the glitter of the gold
piece which the boy dropped into the basket as
the collection was taken for the Indian Mission.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
And this is what he thought: "Here's a boy
who has made a sacrifice; he has given that
which cost him something, and I gave what I
can spare as well as not! for once <i>I</i> will give
something that I shall feel."</p>

<p>"Father, why didn't you buy those horses you
were talking about?" asked Frank Bates a few
days later.</p>

<p>"Because I bought a dog for you instead!"</p>

<p>"But my Jack did not cost a thousand dollars!"
said Frank, puzzled.</p>

<p>"That is just what it cost me," replied Colonel
Bates, smiling at his boy's bewildered looks.
And then he told him the story of the gold
piece and his own sacrifice, and the boy, after a
little silence had fallen between them, said:</p>

<p>"Father, you need not buy the dog cart; the
old pony phaeton will do. Give me the money
it would cost in gold pieces, please, and I will go
to the next missionary meeting and offer <i>my</i>
sacrifice."</p>

<h2>OUR MISSION BAND.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE president of our Band appointed,
at the beginning of the year, twelve
girls and boys to take charge of the
Band Meetings, one for each month.
When Lucia Lawrence read the little
slip of paper upon which was written her subject,
and the month for which she was assigned,
she said brightly,</div>

<p>"I don't know a single thing about Persia, but
I can find out." And I am going to tell you
just a few of the things she found out about
Persia. She found that in July last the semi-centennial
of the beginning of the missionary
work among the Nestorians at Oroomia was
celebrated. More than fifteen hundred Nestorians
came to the jubilee on the college
grounds.</p>

<p>"College grounds!" exclaimed Lucia's brother
Tom as the two sat together working up the
programme, for this brother and sister were accustomed
to study and work together, "do you
mean to say that they have a college over
there?"</p>

<p>"Yes; there are schools of all grades in
Persia," replied Lucia. "The first school was
opened in a cellar with only seven small children;
but now there are village schools, high
schools, seminaries for boys and girls, a college
and theological seminary."</p>

<p>"Are there many who attend these schools?"
asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I do not know what you would call many;
I should think it was a large number, all things
considered, when they can count the day-school
pupils by thousands and the boarding-school
students by hundreds. But the population of
Persia is between seven and eight million, and
there are only seven Mission stations in the
whole country. Five of these are under the
management of the Presbyterian Board of
America, and two are under the care of the
English Church Missionary Society."</p>

<p>"It seems like putting little bits of wedges
into a narrow crack in a big rock and thinking
to split it by pounding with a hammer. The
wedges go all to pieces and the rock stays just
as it was."</p>

<p>"But, Tom, if your wedges are of iron, with
power enough in the arm that strikes the blows,
the rock is bound to yield."</p>

<p>"Yes; but sometimes people use up a lot of
wedges and mallets too."</p>

<p>"Well, these missionaries who had given
their lives as wedges to make an opening for the
Gospel, were only too glad to be used in the
service of Christ. That is what wedges are
made for, I suppose, to be hammered and go to
pieces at last."</p>

<p>"But what did they do at this jubilee? That
is what I want to find out," said Tom.</p>

<p>"Just what we do in this country when we
celebrate. They sold tickets which entitled the
holders to the privilege of spending the night on
the grounds, and also to their meals. The women
were made comfortable in the college building,
but many of the men had to sleep out of doors.
A large booth had been built for the meeting,
and men and women told the story of the last
fifty years. They had 'papers' prepared.
Some of them, on female education, were written
by native women who had been educated in the
schools. They told about the native churches,
about the medical work of the Missions, and
about the hospital; you know the only hospital
in Persia was built by the missionaries. The
history of the work of Miss Fidelia Fiske, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Mrs. Grant and Miss Rice were given. There
was one old woman who came a long distance,
part of the way on foot, and that over a rough
mountainous road, to attend the celebration;
she was one of Miss Fiske's first girls. Seems to
me she might have told a story worth hearing.
The history of the Hamadan Mission is interesting.
Miss Montgomery says, 'What hath God
wrought? Come and see his work in Hamadan.'
Nine years only since the first missionary was
stationed there, and now a church of seventy-five
members. A weekly prayer meeting and a
woman's prayer meeting; a Sunday-school and
several day schools. But this work is done
under the most trying circumstances, without
either church or school buildings. The schools
are gathered in private houses, and in summer
the preaching and other church services are held
in the yard of Miss Montgomery's house and
in winter in the house. It just seemed to me
when I read about the work in Hamadan that I
wanted to be rich. I should think some wealthy
man would want to build a church there."</p>

<p>"It seems as though there is such a wide crack
there a big wedge would go in and do good work."</p>

<p>"There is another thing which is encouraging,"
said Lucia, "and that is the fact that the
people have the Bible in their own language;
that is a big wedge, because you see if they once
get the Bible into their homes the work will go
on faster. The women too are being educated.
There was a strong prejudice against the education
of women, but that is wearing away and
of course the influence of educated Christian
mothers will be a great help. Now, Tom, I am
going to give you the station at Hamadan for
your topic at the meeting, and I shall give Ella
the fire worshipers, and Dick will tell us about
the Mussulmans. Then I must find somebody
who will give an account of the work at Oroomiah.
O, dear! there is so much about Persia
that the hour will not begin to hold it all."</p>

<p>"Well, you may leave something to piece out

enough to fill up."</p>

<p>"What is your topic?" asked Lucia.</p>

<p>"Mexico; and I don't know a thing about it."</p>

<p>Lucia expressed her sympathy by laughing at
him, and saying, "Just wait until you study it
up!"</p>

<h2>SELECTION FOR RECITATION.</h2>

<h3>WHY DID YOU NOT COME BEFORE?</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>[An aged Hindoo woman, while first hearing the Gospel, said,
"Why did you not come before? My hair has grown gray
waiting for the good news."]</p></blockquote>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
AN aged woman, poor and weak,<br />
She heard the mission teacher speak;<br />
The slowly-rolling tears came down<br />
Upon her withered features brown.<br />
"What blessed news from yon far shore&mdash;<br />
Would I had heard it long before.<br />
<br />
"O, I have bowed at many a shrine,<br />
When youth and health and strength were mine;<br />
How earnestly my soul has striven<br />
To find some gleam of light from heaven;<br />
But all my toil has been in vain&mdash;<br />
These gods of stone but mocked my pain.<br />
<br />
"A weary pilgrimage I've trod,<br />
To win some favor from my god;<br />
And all my jewelled wealth I've laid<br />
Beneath the dark Pagoda's shade;<br />
But still, the burden on my breast<br />
Bowed head and heart with sore unrest.<br />
<br />
"Now, I have waited many a day,<br />
My form is bent, my hair is gray;<br />
But still the blessed words you bear<br />
Have charmed away my long despair;<br />
O sisters, from your happy shore,<br />
Would you had sent to me before!<br />
<br />
"O, precious is the message sweet<br />
I hear your kindly lips repeat;<br />
It bids me weep for joy again;<br />
My stony eyes were dry with pain;<br />
My weary heart with joy runs o'er&mdash;<br />
Ah, had you come to me before!<br />
<br />
"How welcome is the glorious name<br />
Of Jesus, who to save me came.<br />
And shall I live when death is past?<br />
And may I all my burdens cast<br />
On Him? And is His mercy free?<br />
Not bought with gifts? Such news for me!<br />
<br />
"Yes, please forgive me when I say,<br />
I've needed this so many a day.<br />
In your glad homes, did ye not know<br />
How India's tears of sorrow flow?<br />
If you had known on that bright shore,<br />
Surely you would have come before!"<br />

<p><i>Maud</i> from Minnesota. Yes, I wrote the
book which was your Christmas present. I am
glad you like it. I think you will like the closing
of the story about "Nettie and Jerry," but
I must not tell you how it ends, for that would
lessen the interest. "In a minute" is a very
troublesome creature; I rejoice that you are going
to get rid of his company.</p>

<p><i>Winnie</i> from Pennsylvania. A "temper" is
a very good servant, but makes a bad master.
If you succeed in keeping rule over yours, as I
know you will if you try, remembering the
"Whisper Motto," you will be much happier and
more useful than you could possibly be if it ruled
you.</p>

<p><i>Deck</i> and <i>Wilder</i> from Minnesota. Yes, indeed,
your letter shall be published, and I hope
"papa" will enjoy it as much as I did. I am
also much obliged to "sister" for writing for you.
Still, I hope you will write me a letter all yourselves,
as soon as you can, and let me know how
you succeed. I am truly glad you have resolved
not to "contradict each other." Do you know
I believe Satan likes to hear people contradict
better than he likes almost any other fault which
well brought up, truthful people have.</p>

<p><i>Newton</i> from Pennsylvania. My boy, we
welcome you with pleasure. To squarely own
a fault is sometimes half the battle. You cannot
be too careful of the words you speak to
"mother." Cross words sometimes sting and
burn after the mothers are gone. Watch carefully,
and resolve to be a joy and comfort to
your mother so long as you have one.</p>

<p><i>Rachel</i> from Kentucky. These "hasty tempers!"
You have only to read the answers to
the Pansies from month to month to discover
how many are troubled with them. It is a wise
thing to begin very early in life to keep them
under control. About the habit of "forgetfulness,"
it sometimes grows on people so rapidly
that they injure all their prospects in life by it.
You do well to watch it.</p>

<p><i>Emma</i> from Massachusetts. It would be very
pleasant to the Pansies to hear the story of some
one whom you succeed in "Helping." Will you
tell it for us? I hope the badge has reached you
long ago, and is a comfort.</p>

<p><i>Ned</i> from Massachusetts. Good for you, my
brave young soldier! A pledge against all that
can intoxicate, and against tobacco, is a grand
thing. I hope every Pansy in the garden will
follow your example. So you are tempted to
say "I don't want to?" Sometimes that isn't a
bad thing to say. If anybody coaxes you to do
wrong, I hope you will always say boldly, "I
don't want to." But if it is something you know
you ought to do, suppose you rush right off and
set about it so quickly that your tongue will
not have time to speak the words. How will
that do?</p>

<p><i>Bessie</i> and <i>Helen</i> form North Carolina.
Bless your dear hearts, of course you will not
fail! Don't think of such a thing. When a
pledge is right to take, and therefore right to
keep, just shut your lips firmly and say, "We
shall succeed, because we ought to, and what we
ought to do, we can." Glad to enroll you.</p>

<p><i>Iya</i> from Minnesota. I wonder if I have the
name right? I am not sure. I hope your
badge gave you help and pleasure. Oh, no, it
costs nothing to belong to the P. S. but a good
strong tussle with one's faults.</p>

<p><i>Arthur</i> from Massachusetts. My boy, if I
should put our roll of honor in <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>,
there would be room for nothing else. There
are thousands and thousands of names! Hurrah
for the temperance pledge! I feel like giving a
hearty cheer for every boy who signs it. I wonder
how many Pansies we have who have done
so? Wouldn't it be nice to know? Dear me,
I hope you are not a lazy boy! Because they
are almost certain to make lazy men. Don't be
a lazy Pansy, please.</p>

<p><i>Cora</i> from South Carolina. So glad to hear
the badge is helping you. Give my love to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Daisy and little Alice; you will have to be a
very careful older sister in order to help them,
will you not? So your dear father has gone to
Heaven? Poor little Blossom! I know how
you miss him. You must be a special flower
for your dear mamma now, shedding all the perfume
you can around her.</p>

<p><i>Martha</i> from Massachusetts. Yes, I know all
about how easy it is to "answer back," and I
know just what a trial it is to the mothers. You
do well to make a great effort to break the power
of the habit. Getting up in the morning isn't
the easiest work in the world for a great many
people. I knew a lady who said she was obliged
to spring out of bed as soon as her eyes were
opened, because if she waited five minutes it
seemed to her that it was not possible to get up!
I suspect, my dear Blossom, that you have a
good mother. There is nothing which needs
more careful guarding than what we read.
Make a rule to read nothing that mother does
not approve.</p>

<p><i>Lena</i> from New York. Glad to hear from
Lena. These dear mothers are worth minding
the very minute they speak. I almost know you
will keep your pledge.</p>

<p><i>Cora</i> from Indian Territory. Welcome, dear
Cora, to our Pansy bed. I am sorry you have
to bloom all alone in your far-away home. Cannot
you find some more Pansies who would bloom
if they had a chance? Try. I know all about
what a nuisance it is to have people around who
do not put away their "things." At this moment
there lies a cap in the very centre of my
study table among the papers. It belongs to a
boy who is shouting at somebody in the kitchen
to know if they have the least idea where his cap
is! He spends an immense amount of time looking
for things that ought to be hanging on their
hooks, or lying properly on their shelves, and
would be, I believe, if they could only walk.</p>

<p><i>Nettie</i> from Ohio. I hope your <span class="smcap">Pansy</span> reaches
you regularly, my dear little girl, and that it
gives you a great deal of comfort. You see
your "prayer" was answered in just the way
you most wanted. Our Father in Heaven always
answers all prayer, but sometimes he has to say
"No" because He can tell whether what we
have asked is the best thing.</p>

<p><i>Edwin</i> from New York. My boy, if you have
done a "kind act" each day since you took your
pledge, you must have some pleasant stories to
tell which the Pansies would like to hear. Cannot
you write out one of them for us?</p>

<p><i>Andrew</i> from Illinois. O the teeth! I am
very glad you have pledged to take care of them.
I know a boy who says he "cannot" remember
to brush his, only on Sundays, and I am very much
afraid the consequence will be, they will not be
worth brushing by the time he is a man. Thank
you for being a worker for <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>. I know
of no better way to show that you like the magazine
than to try to get others to take it.</p>

<p><i>Ethelwyn</i> from Pennsylvania. How many
people have you helped, my dear? And how
many ways have you discovered in which you
can help others? Can we be helpful without
speaking a word? One of the most helpful little
people I know is a deaf and dumb girl. How
do you suppose she manages it?</p>

<p><i>Minnie</i> from Ohio. Dear little friend, it is
very easy to be "impatient." There is a little
girl of my acquaintance who became so impatient
with a door which would not open that she
knocked it with her knee. Now it happened
that in her pocket was a small cushion with
needles on it, and the knock sent a fine needle
into her knee, which caused her dreadful pain
and kept her from taking a step for many weeks.
She used to say, "Oh, dear, if I only <i>hadn't!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Willie</i> from Ohio. I like your pledge. When
a boy has a good father and mother, and pledges
himself always to obey them in everything, he
is about as safe as he can be in this world; especially
if they are Christian people, who say to him,
"My boy, your first duty is to give yourself to
the Lord Jesus to obey him in all things."</p>

<p><i>Jessie</i> from Colorado. I wish you had sent
me a copy of the "Exercise," "Jesus Our Star."
It must have been very beautiful, and perhaps
the Pansies would like to use it in their Sabbath-schools.
Perhaps you can send us a copy
for next Christmas? How many presents you
received! What did you do for those who had
none?</p>

<p><i>Frank</i> from Michigan. So, my seven-year-old
Blossom, you sometimes get angry, do you?
That is bad; the perfume of angry flowers is
very disagreeable. It is well you have taken
the pledge to overcome.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Inez</i> from Indiana. You are not alone in
your fault, my darling. It is as natural for people
to want their own way, as it is to breathe.
The important thing is, to be very pleasant
about giving it up, when for any reason you cannot,
or ought not to have it. This is a thing
well worth trying for.</p>

<p><i>Anne</i> from Washington. I was very deeply
interested in your letter, and have great sympathy
for you in your great affliction. What a
wonderful and blessed thing it will be if all the
members of your large family meet in Heaven!
Are you doing all you can to make sure of that
happy meeting?</p>

<p><i>Florence</i> from New York. A letter "all to
yourself" is something I cannot give, my Blossom,
much as I would like to. Don't you see it
would not be fair to the others? I think you
have the best possible sort of "pet." Finger
nails are very useful things, and have a way of
looking very badly if they are forgotten. I am
glad you are going to care for yours.</p>

<p><i>Edith</i> and <i>Lilian</i> from Massachusetts. I am
always glad to welcome two sisters; I think
they can be such helps to each other. We are
delighted to accept "Grandma" as an "honorary
member." We have a special and tender
love for all the dear grandmas. I have not the
least doubt but she will keep her beautiful pledge
to try to make somebody happy every day; and
I can imagine how happy you two can make her
if she sees you trying.</p>

<p><i>Robert</i> from Massachusetts. So you "don't
like to mind quickly?" Well, never mind whether
you like it or not, if you succeed in doing it. I
think myself it requires a good deal of decision
to accomplish it, and I don't know of any habit
more important to acquire, so I welcome you
with pleasure.</p>

<p><i>Pauline</i> from Massachusetts. My little "wilful"
Blossom! A will is a very good thing if you
make a servant of it, and oblige it to do just the
right thing; but when one gets to be its slave,
oh, dear! I am glad you have begun early to
train it aright.</p>

<p><i>Daisy</i> from New York. Poor finger nails!
How would you like to be bitten every time
you plucked up courage and grew a little.
Don't treat your faithful little servants so badly.
"Clayton" is very nearly right. We can do
almost anything we try hard to do, that is if it
is right that we should do it. For, back of this
idea lies a great truth: God never gives us any
command which is too hard for us to obey. It
is very easy to get angry, and sometimes hard to
break the habit; but it can be done.</p>

<p><i>Lulu</i> from Virginia. Here is another little
Southern Blossom who wants to overcome "all"
her faults. Brave little girl! I am sure you
will succeed much better than those who never
think about their faults at all.</p>

<p><i>Emma</i> from Connecticut. Did she have so
many faults that she couldn't count them? Poor
little robin! Still I suspect that is the honest
truth about every one of us. We are great
bundles of faults. If you try with wide-open
eyes to overcome each as it appears to you, you
will keep a very important pledge.</p>

<p><i>Arthur Fred</i> from Rhode Island. My boy, I
can sympathize with "mamma." I am not sure
that I know a more troublesome small habit than
the one of moving slowly. Especially when one
is waiting for you. Did you ever hear of the
boy who lost his life because he waited to say
"What for?" when told to bend his head? I
could tell you of a little girl who lost a long
delightful journey because she moved so slowly
across a railroad depot that the train went off
and left her behind.</p>

<p><i>Bertha</i> from Maine. "Getting mad!" Oh,
dear! what a sorrowful fault for a little Bertha.
The "Whisper Motto," my dear, is "For Jesus'
Sake." It is called so because though we may
be often in places where we could not whisper
to our father or mother or any earthly friends, it
is not possible to go where we could not speak
to Jesus, and get his help. If you control your
temper for Jesus' sake, you will surely succeed.</p>

<p><i>Lena</i> from Massachusetts. "Little sister"
will have a much happier life because of your
pledge. And she will probably make a better
woman if she lives, because of it. If sisters only
knew how much they could help each other, by
watching their words, I think they would take
your pledge.</p>

<p><i>Helen</i> from Connecticut. You are right, my
friend, everybody has "need of patience." I don't
suppose you will find a day in your life but you
will need a large stock of it to draw from. You
do well to begin early to gather it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Jessie</i> from Connecticut. We are glad to enroll
you among our number. There is no doubt
but that you and your friend can be great helps
to each other. Patient people, those who can
be patient with little trials or annoyances, are
sadly needed in this world. I heard a gentleman
say of a quiet little lady once, that she had
a remarkable mind. "How do you know?" I
asked, for I was aware that he had not talked
much with her. "Because," he said, "I saw her
keep a perfectly quiet face and gentle manner
under a series of annoying circumstances; and
only people with very cultured minds or hearts
can do that."</p>

<p><i>Laura</i> from New Jersey. Your plan for getting
up a P. S. is an excellent one. I hope you
will write and tell us how you succeed. We are
very glad to welcome Andrew. I wish all the
boys in the country would take his pledge to
keep their arms off the table. Wouldn't the
mothers rejoice!</p>

<p><i>Anita Harriet</i> and <i>Ada Maud</i>. Welcome, dear
little sisters, who write such nice letters. Does
the old giant Impatience trouble you so much,
Anita? I suspect about the time he comes along,
Giant Cross gets hold of Maud. Am I right?
Those two are very fond of working together.
You are wise to join hands in fighting them.</p>

<p><i>Harvey</i> and <i>Lillie</i> from New York. A brother
and sister starting out together; that is good.
Harvey, my boy, I don't often get a letter which
gives me more pleasure than did yours. It is
not easy work that you have undertaken, it is
true, but you have a great Helper on your side.
As soon as I can manage it, we must get up a
mammoth temperance organization from the
members of the P. S. As for the little sister,
her sweet and thoughtful pledge will be helpful
to you, as well as to herself.</p>

<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">Dear Pansy</span>:</div>

<p>In reading my magazine I found you would
like to know how your Pansies spent Christmas.
I spent mine very pleasantly; we had a small
tree in our sitting-room, with presents from papa
and mamma, and all the family. In the evening
sister went to the organ and played some
sweet pieces, and we all joined in the singing.
Then we went up to grandpa's. I think the
day was filled with pleasant things.</p>

<p>Dear Pansy, I do try to keep my pledge. I
try hard to keep things in their proper places;
but I find I need to be very watchful, and to
ask for a great deal of help from God. Mamma
has just written to Boston to renew my subscription
to <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>. It is rather late, but

every day, and will promise not to drink any
wine or cider, or anything that will make people
drunk, and to be like the little boy my
grandma read about in <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, who signed

<h2>A FAMILY FLIGHT OVER EGYPT AND
SYRIA.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>I KNOW you are acquainted with the Hales,
Edward Everett and Miss Susan; therefore
you know, without my telling you, that
they write thoroughly delightful books. But I
wonder if you are acquainted with the Horners?
Not the family of "Little Jack Horner" who
"sat in a corner," but some friends of the Hales
who took delightful journeys all over the world.
What I want of you is to accompany them, and
have a good time, and learn more about the
world we live in than you imagined you could
without bidding good-by to your father and
mother, and spending a great deal of money.
This trip is very cheap indeed; in fact, if you
belong to the P. S.&mdash;as of course you do&mdash;it
will actually cost you only one dollar and fifty
cents! Who ever heard of travelling over
Egypt and Spain for a dollar and fifty cents!
For the matter of that, if you are not particular
about the dress, and will choose one a little
plainer, you may save thirty cents and go for a
dollar-twenty. The book has nearly four hundred
pages, and a great many pictures. It is
beautifully bound, and printed on the best of
paper. I do not know how you could have a
prettier ornament for your book table than it
offers.</div>

<p>But the best way of helping you to understand
how well the book is written, is to give
you a piece of it, and I therefore let you have a
peep at Damascus with the Horner family:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>


<h3>DAMASCUS.</h3>

<p>One of the first things the Horners did was to
go to the top of the minaret of the city gate, for
the view which is presented there of the town.</p>

<p>They saw below them a plain of flat roofs,
broken here and there by a white cupola, and a
tall minaret, and the large dome of the great
mosque.</p>

<p>At their feet was the beginning of a narrow
lane, winding along as far as the eye could follow
it. This was the "street called straight,"&mdash;straight,
meaning narrow; for it certainly
would not be called straight in Philadelphia. In
the Roman period of Damascus a noble street
extended through the city in the same direction,
and excavations made under the present Straight
street have revealed fragments of a Corinthian
colonnade which adorned it. For, during the
great age since the founding of Damascus, and
in the many <i>evèuements</i> it has experienced, one
set of buildings after another has been destroyed,
so that, as at Jerusalem, there is supposed to be
layer upon layer of demolished cities to a great
depth, underlying the present one.</p>

<div class="caption">PUBLIC GARDEN, DAMASCUS.</div>
</div>

<p>In the distance they saw Mount Hermon,
snow-covered at the summit. A walk through
this street led them past scenes of the massacre
of 1860, and other interesting sites; then, under
a low Roman arch, they entered the region of
the bazaars. This reminded them of Cairo,
"only more so." The same narrow streets, and
same open fireplaces as Bessie had called them,
where the merchants sat cross-legged, in front
of little shelves, on which were piled their stuffs;
but at Damascus there was a greater variety of
strange and gorgeous materials, rich and splendid.
They could not resist the fascination of
these shops, and bought a good many things,
Hassan doing the bargaining, which consisted
in a long and violent argument between him and
the shopkeeper, ending in a mutual compromise.
Both parties love these tilts of the tongue, and
it is a regular part of shopping in the East.
The dealer demands a price which he does not
dream of receiving, and Hassan mentions a figure
which he knows he shall have to raise. The
squabble became sometimes violent, but after
awhile the repetition was tedious, especially as
our Americans did not understand a word of it.
Miss Lejeune saw some pretty little damask napkins,
for which her soul longed, bordered with
red and yellow stripes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Hassan," said Mr. Horner, "you may
begin the fight over these;" and while it went
on, the party turned their attention to the
crowds flocking by in the narrow streets, dressed
in the brilliant colors of the Orient: the men
with gay turbans, and full trousers of every
bright tint, the women veiled, in dark garments.
A man went by with a cooling drink, rattling
tumblers to attract attention; a lemon was
stuck on the pointed top of the tin vessel he
carried it in. Tommy tried it, and pronounced
it "not bad!"</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 504px;">
<img src="images/illus102.jpg" width="504" height="346" alt="family on rooftop" />
<div class="caption">A HOUSE TOP SCENE, DAMASCUS.</div>
</div>

<p>An expedition on donkeys, which was shared
only by Mr. Hervey, Miss Lejeune and Bessie,
while the others were busy in bazaars, was to
Salahiyah, a suburb of Damascus. They rode at
first through a narrow lane, with high blank
walls on either side. The houses of Damascus
are all built in this way, with all their pleasantness
concentrated within, upon an interior court.
The street walls are without windows or access,
except through heavy doors. This is on account
of the numerous attacks the inhabitants have received,
leading them to protect their outer works.</p>

<p>They stopped before a dingy little door, and
knocked. They had to stoop to enter, when lo!
they heard the sound of a rushing fountain, and
found themselves standing on a balcony surrounded
by orange and lemon-trees. Roses and
fleur-de-lis were blooming along the paths of a
lovely garden, through which poured a deep,
though narrow river, with its edge tufted with
maiden-hair and grasses that danced in the water.
A slowly turning wheel lifted water from the
stream to feed the little fountain.</p>

<p>The gentlemanly proprietor, in a turban and
gown of striped red and blue cotton, spread a carpet
and brought chairs for them to repose upon,
while he entertained them by playing upon a musical
instrument something like a fiddle, and there
they ate their picnic lunch, which Hassan, who
accompanied them, had brought. This was his
surprise. He had proposed the expedition, and
was disappointed that the whole party did not
join it; but for some reason, they had not understood
the extent of the plan, and so the others
lost seeing the pretty garden.</p>

<p>There is much more about Damascus, for
which I have not room. There is much to delight
you in the book. I hope you will be able
to own it, and will give it careful reading.</p>

<div class='adtitle2'>WONDER STORIES OF SCIENCE.</div>

<div class='center'><b>Price, 1.50.</b></div>

<p>To improve as well as to amuse young people is the object
of these twenty-one sketches, and they fill this purpose
wonderfully well. What boy can fail to be interested in
reading an account of an excursion made in a balloon and
a race with a thunder-storm? And is there a girl who
would not enjoy an afternoon in the Christmas-card factory?
It is a curious fact that only one hundred and thirty years
ago the first umbrella was carried in London, much to the
amusement of the ignorant, and now there are seven millions
made every year in this country. And who would believe it
possible that there was a large factory full of women who
earned their living by making dolls' shoes. A bright girl
or boy who insists to know something about the work done
in the world, who does it, and how it is done, cannot fail
to enjoy these stories. The writers are all well-known
contributors to children's periodical literature, and the book
will be a welcome addition to any child's library, and might
be used with advantage as a reading book in schools.</p>

<p>The entire framework is made from Iron, painted
and Japanned black, and ornamented with red and gilt
stripes.</p>

<p>All parts made to interchange.</p>

<p>1. The Bearings to the Arms are carefully sized to
bring them in perfect line. (This is a vital point in the
construction of any Jig Saw.)</p>

<p>2. Each machine is provided with a Dust Blower,
which is a very great advantage.</p>

<p>3. Our machine has a jointed Stretcher Rod, which
allows the operator to throw the upper arm out of the
way when adjusting his work or saw. This joint also
permits the machine to work much more freely than
with a straight iron rod.</p>

<p>4. Our clamps have a hinged jaw which overcomes
the disagreeable raking overthrow of the blade, which
is unavoidable when the saws are secured rigidly to the
arms. Saw blades are not nearly so liable to break
when clamps have this joint. Thus a large percentage
of the expense of running the saw is saved. Besides
this the saw runs much easier, the swing coming at the
hinge instead of bending the blade with each stroke of
the saw.</p>

<p>5. The Balance wheel is 4-1/4 inches in diameter,
with a handsome spoke centre and Rim of Solid Emery.</p>

<p>6. The attachment for Drilling is on the Right Hand
Side of the machine, which, for convenience, is an obvious
advantage.</p>

<p>7. No Pins are used in the construction of this machine,
as we prefer the durability of nicely fitted screws
and bolts in securing each part.</p>

<p>While the New Rogers' Saw is very rich, though not gaudy in appearance, it has been more especially
our object to make, for the least possible money, a saw characterized for its Compactness, Strength,
and durability, ease of action, and firmness when in operation.</p>

<p>With each machine we give six Saw Blades, Wrench, Sheet of Designs and three Drill Points. The
Saw alone weighs 25 lbs.; Saw and Box together, 36 lbs.</p>

<p>Price of No. 2 Rogers' Saw, $4.00. This Saw is provided with a polished Tilting Table, heavily
nickel-plated. <b>Receiver to pay express or freight charges.</b></p></blockquote>

teachers who wish to start their "little primaries" in the lines on which older brothers and sisters are
being taught. As a beginning in American History, there will be twelve charming chapters about</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>THE ADVENTURES OF COLUMBUS.</div>

<div class='adtitle4'>OUR COLORADO PETS</div>

<div class='hang1'>will describe wild creatures little known to children in general. These twelve stories all
are true, and are full of life and adventure; each will be illustrated.</div>


<div class='adtitle4'>"ME AND MY DOLLS"</div>

author, Miss L. T. Meade. It will have Twelve Full-page Pictures by Margaret Johnson.</div>

<p>The works issued in this library are uniformly of a high standard and may well come under that class of literature
styled "home fiction," a literature, that, while free from the flashy, sensational effect of much of the fiction of to-day, is,
nevertheless, brilliant in style, fresh and strong in action, and of absorbing interest. It is a class that all the young folks,
as well as the fathers and mothers and older brothers and sisters, may read with profit as well as great pleasure.</p>

<p><b>1. THE PETTIBONE NAME, by Margaret Sidney</b>, author of <i>The Five Little Peppers</i>, etc. It is a delightful
story of New England life and manners, sparkling in style, bright and effective in incident, and of intense interest.
There has been no recent figure in American fiction more clearly or skilfully drawn than Miss Judith Pettibone. Most
of the characters of the book are such as may be met with in any New England village.</p>

<p><b>2. MY GIRLS. By Lida A. Churchill.</b> A story of four ambitious girls. Their struggles to realize their
ambitions and their trials and successes, make a story of intense interest.</p>

<p><b>3. WITHIN THE SHADOW, by Dorothy Holroyd.</b> "The most successful book of the year." "The
plot is ingenious, yet not improbable, the character drawing strong and vigorous, the story throughout one of brilliancy
and power." "The book cannot help making a sensation."&mdash;<i>Boston Transcript.</i></p>

<p><b>4. FAR FROM HOME.</b> From the German of Johannes Van Derval. Translated by <b>Kathrine Hamilton</b>.
A fascinating story of life and travel in foreign lands.</p>

<p><b>5. GRANDMOTHER NORMANDY. By the author of Silent Tom.</b> The story is fascinatingly told.
The character of Grandmother Normandy, stern, relentless and unforgiving, almost to the last, is strongly drawn, and
the author has shown much skill in the construction of the story.</p>

<p><b>6. AROUND THE RANCH. By Belle Kellogg Towne.</b> It is original, fresh, and written with great
naturalness and power; its pathos is exquisitely touching. The opening scenes are laid in the Colorado mining regions.</p></div>

<div class='center'><br />PANSY'S NEW BOOKS.</div>

<p>Among the new books by this favorite author, which
Sunday-school Superintendents and all readers of her previous
books will wish to order, are:&mdash;</p>

<p><b>One Commonplace Day.</b> Pansy has brought out in
this book a vivid, lifelike story, full of strong incentives to
right thinking and living. 12mo, cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p><b>Interrupted.</b> Has all the charm of this author's style,
grown riper each year. 12mo, extra cloth, $1.50.</p>

<p><b>In the Woods and Out.</b> Admirably suited to the
needs of a large class of young folks. It is composed of the
choicest of short tales so delightful at the twilight hour when
the children clamor for "a story." 12mo, cloth, $1.00.</p>

<p><b>The Browning Boys.</b> A fascinating story of the growth
of two boys who set out on their birthday to be helpful at
home. By applying the "golden texts" of the International
Sunday-school lessons in their every-day life, they, without
swerving from the strictest sense of right, are able to send
their invalid father to Florida, and were the means of his
restoration to health. 16mo, cloth, 60 cents.</p>

<p><b>A Hedge Fence.</b> A story that will be particularly
pleasing to boys, most of whom will find in its hero a fair
representation of themselves. 16mo, 60 cents.</p>

<p><b>An Endless Chain.</b> From the introduction, on the first
page, of the new superintendent of the Packard Place Sabbath-school,
to the end, there is no flagging of interest in this
bright, fresh, wholesome story. Illustrated. 12mo., $1.50.</p>

<p><b>Side by Side.</b> Short illustrated stories from Bible texts
for the help of boys and girls in their every-day duties.
16mo., cloth, 60 cents.</p>

<p><b>Christie's Christmas.</b> No more charming little heroine
can be found than the Christie of this volume, and the story
of her journey to spend Christmas, with the great variety of
characters introduced, all of them original and individual in
their way, is perfectly novel and interesting.</p>

<p>As a guide to teachers, rich in suggestions and directions
for methods of teaching, etc., there is nothing better than
<b>Pansy's Scrap Book</b>. 12mo., cloth, illustrated, $1.00.</p>

<p>In fact all of Pansy's books have some special charm or
attraction which makes them a power for good wherever
read.</p>

<p><i>Ladies and Gentlemen</i>,&mdash;Because we know that to you
it is, and should be, largely entrusted to advise our young
people in regard to their reading, because you are powerful
guardians of "literature for the young," we invite you to
examine the periodicals we publish monthly for children and
young folks: <b>Wide Awake</b>, <b>The Pansy</b>, <b>Our Little
Men and Women</b>, and <b>Babyland</b>. We will supply you
with specimens of these, if you will call, or if you will write
us. These magazines are in the watchful and trained care
of their original editors, and the same purity, strength, and
sparkle characterize each number from month to month,
from year to year. The highest order of fiction, the most
inspiring, lifting, and refining poetry, the most instructive
lessons in history and natural science, the most entertaining
records of travel and adventure, the finest literary and biographical
articles, appear in their pages. <i>The Congregationalist</i>
said last week of <span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span>, that it "sets its
readers to thinking for themselves along many different lines.
It has solved the problem how to proportion fun and soberness
best in such a publication better than any of its rivals."
<i>Literary Life</i>, after saying that "<span class="smcap">Wide Awake</span> is the best
monthly magazine for young folks published in the country,"
goes on to say of it, "Next to watching Nature herself, it is
the finest educational work we ever have seen for children.
A child made happy by such a work will possess an intelligence
and richness of mind beyond the mere range of school
lessons." We do indeed confidently trust that should you
direct your classes to our magazines, you will find them a
good means of preparation of hearts and minds for your own
important work. You will find the magazines graded suitably
for the use of infant classes, and upwards.</p>

<div class='center'><br />(<i>From the N. Y. Tribune.</i>)</div>

<p>Among publishers who have carried into their work serious
convictions as to their duty to the public in the matter of
supplying good literature, and who have resolutely resisted
all temptations in the more lucrative direction of that which
is simply sensational, an honorable place may be claimed
for D. Lothrop &amp; Co., who have accomplished in the United
States a work second to that of no publishing-house.</p>

<p>This work was undertaken by D. Lothrop &amp; Co. years
ago. With the firm conviction that ultimate success would
attend their efforts, they have employed the pens of scores
of those who have shared their convictions, including some
of the best-known authors at home and abroad, and have
sent out an ever-increasing stream of pure, attractive, and
instructive literature, which has reached every part of the
land, and made their name famous everywhere.</p>

<p>In a general way the public are familiar with the aims of
this house, and have come to regard its imprint upon a book
as a guaranty of excellent in all essential qualities.</p>

<p>The mechanical plan of the SELF-INKING
PRESS is the same as with the hand inker except
that inking rollers are added to work by the
